title: Dynabook
---

## An electronic tool designed with children and learners in mind, named by ((5d17dca5-c94d-4590-88a2-0c11395b6bf4)) in the paper "A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages".

## On the first page of this paper, Kay says the Dynabook may "provide us with a better 'book', one which is active (like the child) rather than passive… with the attention grabbing powers of TV, but controllable by the child rather than the networks. It can be like a piano: (a product of technology, yes), but one which can be __a tool, a toy, a medium of expression__, a source of unending pleasure and delight … Just as with the book, it brings a new set of horizons and a new set of problems."

## **The Dynabook Library is**
### for learning, teaching, and exploring

### storing what you find in a portable environment

### It can go with you everywhere

### It is a place for sharing art and knowledge

### in new interactions between authors, readers, and text

### It can host the whole library of human civilization

### accessible, adaptable, brought to life in new forms –

### words, images, and sounds interacting.

### It is a tableau for your web of ideas – those that are public and personal.

### It is a makhzan — an electronic storehouse of information.

### It is a translator and tour guide, an informative assistant when needed.

### It is made to enjoy books

### Read a really good story, or listen to one

### Learn a new subject – you control the breadth and depth.

### These books respond to touch and speech

### and allow direct manipulation and questioning.

### Play with models and examples, watch them run

### Write in workbooks, in the allotted space or in the margins.

### Mark anywhere and make notes in public texts or those you own.

### Follow references, journey between books,

### ramble through your library any way you choose.

### Its dynamic nature is in the reading experience and the content.

### Connected to 'the grid', people can find and sample books (in fair length)

### buy them, retrieve them, and publish them.  Also collaborate or communicate.

### Its handheld device could also be a music machine, a newspaper, a little theater —

### one question is how much to integrate within the Dynabook Library?

### Organization is natural and easy on the device

### It is intimate and comfortable, doesn't get in your way

### If desired, it can record your spoken thoughts and provide blank 'pages' to write upon.

### You can compose active essays or longer works within the Library.

### 

### It requires electricity!  Also, lots and lots of infrastructure (telecom) or 'the grid' to which it connects and where master copies are stored.  Is this a big liability?

## I want to explore, study, practice, __try at this thing__ - starting today as a novice.  Aim to become an 'expert user' rather than developer, a reader before publisher, a meta-practitioner of the art.  Dynamic e-books are the crux of it.  There are some essential ingredients: electronics, non-paper display, use of visual presentation apart from text or use of other senses, fluidity, adaptiveness.

## I hope, I anticipate, __I want it to be so__, that Apple's $500 iPad could be a channel for these dynabooks.  My ambition doesn't have to be gaining the expertise and capital to become a 'market leader' of something I'm selling - although I don't rule that out.  I sense that other people are thinking about these same possibilities, and some form of the technology will come sooner or later, perhaps on the iPad or rival devices.

## What I do want to prepare myself for is this: how to author, adapt, and deliver fantastic high-quality reading experiences (such buzz!) of varying size and shape - active essay, full-length e-book, or a confluence of 'zine articles / video / non-linear hypertext, what have you.  I can't go technology nuts and lose myself in these competing frameworks.  Pursue the content.  Pursue its richest manifestation.  Keep my eye on the multitude of media possibilities desired, the evolutionary steps in linking, expositing, questioning - __how I want to read and interact.  __Whoever hawks the tools, use them or adapt them to my need.  Stay focused on the 'state of the art' - with more emphasis on __art__ than technical implementation.

## E-reading technics are like paint pigments, quality of canvas, book typography, or music studio recording equipment.  The details do matter and must be attended to.  I need to choose what details I rely on someone else for, but not get lost in selecting those and endlessly 'twiddling with dials.'

### With this new technology, aging vision will deny no one the pleasure of reading a book.  The whole library of human civilization will be accessible and portable to everyone.  Textual appearances will adapt.  Pages will flood with summoned content: words, images, and sounds interacting.

### Text can be magnified and displayed with consideration to lighting and contrast in different environments.

### Text-to-speech synthesis, speed of audio may be controlled.

### If an audio book exists read by a voice actor, a spoken excerpt should be allowed from the reader's desired point in a book.  If they purchase the audio form, allow to freely switch between reading the text and listening to the book read aloud - for example, during a commute.

### Respond to "voice-over" commands that interrupt the audio book, whether synthesized or recorded voice.  These interruptions may be spoken requests to __Define that word__, read the Wikipedia entry on a given term, or go back in the audio, repeat the last dialogue or sentence x, etc.

### Links within text, from table of contents, or endnotes, or references to other sections.

### Full text search for words or phrases.

### Annotation, page markers, highlighting text.

### Words or terminology defined, words pronounced, biographical information retrieved, encyclopedia or curated reference sources opened on command, to answer the reader's question __Who or what is this?__ or __What does that mean?__

### All references made to other books can be followed, display the citation in its context (at least a surrounding page.)

### Scanning pen to transfer excerpts to note cards, identify passages, search, other reasons to input from paper book to Dynabook Library?

### Google Docs (spreadsheet) is a possible format or set of functionality for the active essays

### TI n-Spire features - calculator, graphs and geometry, tables, statistics, notes

### "Literate" form of programming, visual everywhere possible - like how spreadsheet formulas can be constructed with direct color-coded references to cells.

### Form factor ranges from 3x5-ish cards (notecards, oblique cards, or even tarot) to active essays, graphic novels, full-length books.

### iTunes LP format

### The Glass Bead Game on iPad, especially if it can link directly to texts, music, mathematical models.

## intellectual development is rooted in rich childhood experiences that combine healthy emotional relationships, physical engagement with the real world, and the exercise of imagination in self-generated play and in the arts. **Intense use of computers can distract children and adults from these essential experiences.**
### —Jane M. Healy, Educational Journalist, Fool's Gold (?)
#### 

### Children are born artists. They are naturally creative - eager to sing, dance, pound rhythmically on tabletops, act out great dramas from their own shared imaginations, and design masterpieces with sand, shells, stones, logs, clay, paint, crayons, or any other material that's handy.

### Computers are perhaps the most acute symptom of the rush to end childhood. The national drive to computerize schools, from kindergarten on up, emphasizes only one of many human capacities, one that naturally develops quite late - analytic, abstract thinking - and aims to jump start it prematurely.

### Through this play, children expand their imagination to acquire "the power to generate playfully one's own images and to transform them in the mind's eye, which scientists now theorize, later becomes the capacity to play with challenging mathematical, scientific, and cultural concepts in ways that create new insights."

### Emotional bonds with the rest of the natural world help us to mature physically, intellectually, and spiritually. Nature's diversity nourishes our material needs, including food, clothing, medicines, even the air we breathe. But it also builds our emotional capacity for kinship, affection, awe, nurturing, and beauty; promotes our intellectual capacity for problem-solving, creativity, discovery, and control; and helps stimulate the recognition of a just and purposeful existence.

### Play is the exultation of the possible. — Martin Buber

### Traditionalists stress the importance of play - especially make-believe play – because it "contributes in unique and critical ways to children's intellectual, social, and emotional development. In contrast, studies over the same time period have failed to demonstrate that computers in elementary education make any critical contribution to children's development. Yet playtime in many classrooms is being sacrificed, as computer time increases."

## Understanding and using standard (music) notation requires such a significant commitment in time and education that most people give up experimenting with music in their early lives. If they did not have formal music lessons or an informal discovery process…then the world of music creation would be largely closed to them.

## Lecture by ((5d17dca5-c94d-4590-88a2-0c11395b6bf4)) entitled "Doing with Images Makes Symbols: Communicating With Computers"
### At one point Kay is talking about teaching children to program and the importance of computer literacy. For Kay, literacy isn't understanding computer jargon or being able to check your email. He defines three aspects of literacy:
#### **Access Literacy** is reading. You must be able to understand the intent of others.

#### **Creative Literacy** is writing. You should be able to express your intent.

#### **Literature** gives us genres and different ways of understanding what you are reading or writing. Kay's ideal is that people should be able to make the computer do anything they can think of.

### http://www.cuberick.com/2007/11/you-arent-computer-literate-unless-you.html

### * Literacy: (1) access literacy - reading, (2) creative literacy - writing, (3) genre literacy - for anything we can be literate in, there is a literature, need to understand genre conventions to be able to read.  (genre: shaping context of style and form)
