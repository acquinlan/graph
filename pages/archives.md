## The Allure of the Archives
### by Arlette Farge, published 1981

### Translated by Thomas Scott-Railton

### (Discovered reading Brenda Wineapple's [book review](http://www.threepennyreview.com/samples/wineapple_su14.html) in __The Threepenny Review__.)

### 

### The archive lays things bare, and in a few crowded lines you can find not only the inaccessible but also the living. Scraps of lives dredged up from the depths wash up on shore before your eyes. Their clarity and credibility are blinding. Archival discoveries are a manna that fully justify their name: __sources__ as refreshing as wellsprings.

### …

### The world stands still, stiff as a statue. The index books are sibylline to anyone who does not know their code. Breathing quietly, each person hunts for the magic words that will open the door to them, although only one door at a time, of course.

### …

### In the murmurs of thousands of words and expressions, you might be tempted to look only for the extraordinary or the clearly revealing. This is a mistake. Seemingly insignificant and unimportant details can reveal what was unspoken… trace intimate outlines and capture the thousands of ways each person has of communicating with the world.

### …

### Our task is to find a language that can integrate singular moments into a narrative capable of reproducing their roughness… We need a language that is capable of reconstructing and deconstructing, playing with the similar as with the different. **The human being captured in documents** is, as Michel Foucault has written, __"interwoven in his own being with histories that are neither subordinate to him nor homogenous with him."__

### …

### If we aim to "defend stories" and bring them into history, we must commit ourselves to demonstrating in a compelling manner the ways in which each individual constructed her own agency out of what history and society put at her disposal.

### …

### The history of individuals can shake our received wisdom about the ensemble of behaviors and events that we consider to be collective. Yet at the same time, we can only study individuals through their interactions with social groups.

### …

### **In the end, there is no such thing as a simple story, or even a settled story.**
If the archive is to serve as an effective social observatory, it will only do so through the scattered details that have broken through, and which form a gap-riddled puzzle of obscure events. You develop your reading of the archives through ruptures and dispersion, and must mold questions out of stutters and silences. It is like a kaleidoscope revolving before your eyes. Pausing for an instant, it fixes the precise shapes of imagined figures, which then burst into iridescent light before coming together in different configurations.These figures are ephemeral, and the smallest movement scatters them to produce others. The meaning that can be found in the archive has both the strength and the evanescence of these images that are one by one brought forward by the whirlwind of the kaleidoscope.

### …

### The historian cannot be narrator alone; he must also explain and persuade, providing detailed explanations because he knows that contrary ones can be always be advanced. The first illusion that must be cast aside is that of the definitive truthful narrative. A historical narrative is a construction, not a truthful discourse that can be verified on all of its points.

### …

### It is possible to cast aside the illusion of universality, of a total and definitive truth that can be reconstructed in its entirety. At the same time, one cannot dismiss the truth, nor even be scornful of it. The truth must never be led astray, and the space between these two poles is often quite narrow. When building a relationship with the archive you become very conscious of these two imperatives, and of how important it is for them to work together.

### __History's goal is the understanding of a time and a world.__

### From **Brenda Wineapple**'s review:
#### The novelist creates a world out of her imagination, which is fine; but the historian is an ethicist, not a fabulist. The stakes are high. The lives she narrates were the real lives of real people, and “if we are to do right by these many forgotten lives, lives ground by the political and judicial systems, we can only do so through the writing of history.” Otherwise, Farge feels, we betray them by making them heroes who would be “immediately lumped in with so many other heroes, whose defining trait is that they were put in motion and controlled by an author’s hand.”

#### …

#### __The Allure of the Archives__ is more than a reflection, however evocative, on the seductive joys and travails of research; it is a methodological handbook. “History is never the simple repetition of archival content,” Farge writes, “but a pulling away from it, in which we never stop asking how and why these words came to wash ashore on the manuscript page.”

#### …

#### “We cannot bring back to life those whom we find cast ashore in the archives,” Farge admits. “But this is not a reason to make them suffer a second death.” So we untie the ribbons on those packets to tell better tales, responsible tales, tales about “humanity and forgetting, origins and death. About the words each of us uses to enter into the debates that surround us.” __That__ is the allure of the archives.
