## June 3, 2014, I created this name for my then-future wife, to be her alias in wikiverse.

## 

## __I am my own person…__
### constantly on a self-improvement plan

### kind, calm, and intense

### honest to a fault, truly passionate, and stubborn

### a bit eccentric, and tend to choose the path less traveled

### I decide the paths I take in life; nobody has the right to decide for me.

### I tend to overthink things.

### 

## __What summons her…__
### rationalizing decisions, thinking outside the box,

### achieving goals,

### remaining strong in times of crisis,

### and music.

## ⁞:.
### Seven dots made up of three punctuation marks, including the obscure vertical four dots. This sequence 4+2+1 is also binary representation of the number seven (111 in base-2.)

## I begin today with new-found bliss
Knowing, my Carmen, that you exist,
And the memory of our kiss
Is a sweet, low song
from a distant shore…
That is also my home.
