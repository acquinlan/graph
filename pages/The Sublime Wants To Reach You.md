title: The Sublime Wants To Reach You
---

## by Mira Fong

## 

## To gaze deeply is to beÂ broken
To be seized by obscured things
Inside your chest, a mute space expands
Where mountains and desert undergo metamorphosis
Suspended in the eyes of the unforeseen

## 

## Look, a beam of light pierces the sky
As the darkening shadow meets the luminous
The sky opens, an invitation from the sublime
It needs your attendance

## 

## There, rises a mysterious star
Announcing the full dimension of the sacred
Embroidered in a secret garden
The evening primrose opens its petals
A luring smile
Where are you now?

## 

## Somewhere, an echo
The uneasy call of a black bird
Harkens to vanishing things
Can you feel their still warm presence?


## 

## Pervade me, you say
With your eyes closed
Breathing confusion as you **roam**
In the time of no longer
Obeying only the benevolent law of physics

## 

## You are here to live

## 

## Venturing through the gate of death
Leaving and arriving all at once
Our bodies merge with the contours of the earth
Worlds collapsing and re-surging
Where fruits and planets are safely held

## 

## The sublime wants to reach you.

## __You are welcome to post my poem, glad that you like it. Poetry (it has wings) and philosophy (critical thinking) are the passions of my life. I enjoyed reading your sites. Rilke is my beloved poet and "Ishmael" is a great book.__
