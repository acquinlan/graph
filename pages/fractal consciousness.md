## **Fractal Theory of Consciousness**
### **Synchronicity, Collective Unconscious, and the 'Paranormal'**
#### Explained by way of analogy:
##### Constant movement of earth (geophysical / seismological) #:: human nocturnal dreams

##### Geological fault lines #:: the psychologically troubled #:: boundary points or limits within 'The Fractal'

#### Only consciousness can be 'cursed', not houses, objects, or words. The phenomena of ghosts or past-life memories are manifested in certain people, or regions of the fractal consciousness.
##### __Curses go extinct when a biological line or family pattern ends;__

##### but the curse may have a 'correspondance'.

#### 'Past-life incarnations' and 'doppelgangers' are correspondances across the Fractal’s symmetric regions. Occasionally they co-exist in living bodies, but more often as potential, a similar consciousness forward or backward in time, and sometimes in a 'world that might be.'

#### Souls on the fractal boundaries (or 'fault lines' ) will at times experience its quaking, and are more likely to connect with 'other / mirror souls' in stories, dreams, art, or hallucinations.

### **Fractal Properties**
#### Fine, detailed structure at arbitrary scales

#### Consciousness as one of its __emergent properties__

#### Irregularity that is not easily described in traditional geometric or scientific language

#### __"Smoothly piling up surfaces" and "swirls upon swirls"__

#### Multifractal scaling is characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule: a system in which a single exponent (the fractal dimension) is not enough to describe its dynamics.

#### Fractal complexity may not always be resolvable into easily grasped units of detail and scale…" (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension).) The possibility space in which they propagate is vast and interconnected, possessing __holism__ (an overused term) and distinct parts…

#### Multifractal systems are common in nature, especially geophysics.

#### An attractor is a set of physical properties toward which a system tends to evolve, regardless of the starting conditions of the system. Property values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed.

#### An attractor is called **strange** if it has a fractal structure … often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but there also exist __strange attractors__ which are not chaotic.

## **Fractal Poem and Prose**
### __we are living fractals. everything living is a fractal. everything in the universe is an iteration in a fractal. perhaps this is why mandalas are so appealing.__

### With its self-similar fractal structure, the whole is a key to the parts…

### In every object, __mountain, tree, and star__ — in every birth and life,
As part of each — evolved from each — meaning, behind the ostent,
A mystic cipher waits infolded.
