## No —
Another shall Never
(though many may try)
decide or define,
by name, face, or sign,
You who I knew —
a soul being true.

## 

## Yes!
True, untamed and Free:
this maple twig ~ a twisted key
unlocking the space within,
True is neither and both, ever
held-forth, strange yet kin —
a life being led.

## 

## Here —
led so deftly, tethered
(in a thousand lines of sight)
by this Heart which sheltered
words and plans kept right;
our story ages backward —
dreamer being brave.

## Commentary unpacking each stanza:
### **No**
#### the process of finding one's true self by rejecting exterior labels

#### reclaiming you who I __knew__
(past-tense, before society got a hold of you / me / us)

#### with the definitions stripped away

#### — __all__ of them: name, face, sign (a degree, title, wedding band, profession, every conceivable sign or sigil we've attached to ourselves)

### 

### **Yes**
#### You, yes You!

#### with an exclamatory __Yes!__ to what remains after the first stanza's shedding

#### Truth found in untamed Nature, symbolized by a maple twig
##### — also Martin Buber's "streak of sun on a maple twig" {{{alias ((d35e5d00-5209-403d-93f3-bc675881dbac))→}}}

##### — and the poem "Ars Poetica" by Archibald MacLeish, describing "an empty doorway and a maple leaf" {{{alias ((bd79b921-2ac4-44c6-8804-39003cc13787))→}}}

#### 

#### __I am one small twig on the Tree of Life.__

#### 

#### The **~** glyph resembles a twig twisted into a key
##### a key not to a door outside, but unlocking boundless space within

#### an identify composed of opposites and contradictions
##### (Whitman's __"I contain multitudes.__"

##### Role, profession, or even gender does not contain me

##### Saying yes to neither and both — the end of binary thinking

##### __held-forth:__  held (intimately, private) and forth (to the world)

#### The "soul" remembered in the first stanza becomes a "life" to be __led__, not contemplated

### 

### **Here**
#### led here, to this very moment, the culmination of an entire life history

#### It's a deft balancing act to contain all those "dozens of people" who I am (borrowing my friend Ryan's words.)

#### Each "line of sight" is a past or present relationship, a life experience, a viewpoint adopted as we grew up, and every major step in the path (blunders and triumphs alike.)

#### Also practice unfailing honesty in our relationships (the words and plans we speak to others.)

#### Our story ages backward — to the original raw potential we could access in childhood; with the trappings of "maturity" undone … age back into boyhood?
##### __Puer aeternus?__
###### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus

#### the first stanza's "soul" > "life" stops hunting out a path to follow, or a way to be "led" (second stanza), and becomes a "dreamer" brave enough to __live, act, and__ . . . . . (what word?)

#### **__… brave enough for Destination__**
##### not a noun signifying a place; but describing the __action__ of working out one's destiny
