## The many books and strange figures and the lovely thoughts around you are **ghosts** of the spirits that have been before you. The words your lips utter are the link in the chain that binds you and your fellow men. The youth that toys with your desires is he who will open the gate of your heart for light to enter.
### — Kahlil Gibran, "Wisdom and I"

## "No, we want you to sing for us, speak for us, redeem our lives," the **ghosts clamored**, victims and victimizers, their voices intertwined.

## Every life is in many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, **ghosts**, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love. But always meeting ourselves.

## I fear not spirits, **ghosts, of which I am one**, — __that__ my body might, — but **I fear bodies**, I tremble to meet them. What is this Titan that has possession of me? Talk of mysteries! … __Contact! Contact! Who__ are we? __where__ are we?"

## First, we must abandon our fantasies about multiple selves and multiple lives. We must embrace a particular trajectory [our karma] and accept its consequences for the person we shall become.

## Then, we will struggle to learn how to **feel the ghostly movements** of the missing limbs: by an act of __imaginative love__, we must imagine the experience of the people we did not become.

## So lead me back … from that place
And close my eyes to __my recent disgrace__
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and __they will hear me roar__

## …

## The **ghosts** that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life
And the **ghosts** that we knew will flicker from view
__And we'll live a long life__
