## Maybe you’ve been approaching it as a tree-structure instead of a lattice-like-structure?

“A City Is Not A Tree,” comes to mind.  (((f4bf5073-6a83-456c-b8e6-4e2b7f59d961)))

#### Whatever the truth, Roam appears or feels more constrained than tiddly (where you can do literally anything).

#### Part of that is cultural messaging mixed with a deeper understanding of the guts of #TiddlyWiki. I know the extent of its vast capabilities whereas with roam it's a place where I type and the magic happens.

#### But also it is the difference in contextualisation between tiddlers and blocks. Being in the outline/graph is meaningfully constraining.

#### In the past few weeks that constraint has been lessening as roam gains features or features are revealed (diagrams, etc.) Those features are noisy and distracting, even if ignored.

#### Were it me I’d focus on refining linking, reference discovery, and transclusion until it became second nature smooth. The fundamental piece will always be the writing and working it for meaning.
