### Don Delillo said … “The writer sets her pleasure, her **eros**, against the great, megalithic death that is history's most enduring work. I [Jackson] take that death to be not just the literal extinction of life after life, but the extinguishing of **the narrative pulse** of all those lives under the granite gravity of history recorded. History is a cold, congealed thing, but if it is not too far past, there are strands of DNA, molecules of story imbedded in it, which can be rejoined and reanimated…" (Shelley Jackson, 1995)

### … cinema verite, spanning senses

### __"She saw, not the world of visual form as she knew it, but a multifaceted prism of light and shade intertwined with streaks of color. Traces of scent bombarded her… Nothing happened in words or even pictures, exactly, but more as an overlay of images and smells and movements and feelings, like the body sense of magnetic north, feelings of rightness or wrongness."__

## **Ethnography** > raw empirical data and historic archives
### … data as Ethnography and Social Observatory

### __"If the archive is to serve as an effective social observatory, it will only do so through the scattered details that have broken through, and which form a gap-riddled puzzle of obscure events."__ (Arlette Farge, 2013)
#### wider context from __The Allure of the Archives__:
##### In the end, there is no such thing as a simple story, or even a settled story. If the archive is to serve as an effective social observatory, it will only do so through the scattered details that have broken through, and which form a gap-riddled puzzle of obscure events. You develop your reading of the archives through ruptures and dispersion, and must mold questions out of stutters and silences.

##### It is like a kaleidoscope revolving before your eyes. Pausing for an instant, it fixes the precise shapes of imagined figures, which then burst into iridescent light before coming together in different configurations.These figures are ephemeral, and the smallest movement scatters them to produce others. The meaning that can be found in the archive has both the strength and the evanescence of these images that are one by one brought forward by the whirlwind of the kaleidoscope.
