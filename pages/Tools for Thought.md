## __an exquisite personal environment…
as immediate and tactile as a sketch pad
in which you can effortlessly mingle
writing, drawing, painting, music,
and all the structured leverage of math and science…
every aspect of that system described in itself,
equally amenable to examination and composition…
it extends out over the internet and live culture,
including and leveraging off the work of others…
enabling new forms of communication and collaboration…__

## **Tools Discovered**
### **GLisp**
#### [@prathyvsh](https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1326899743176462337) – Starting this series with Baku’s GLisp editor — A Lisp-based design tool that bridges graphic design and computational arts. It is a polished product that shows the power of having linguistic abstractions juxtaposed with an interactive design space: [https://glisp.app](https://t.co/Q0VZA7013b?amp=1)

#### [Twitter #glisp posts by its creator baku89](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23glisp%20@_baku89)

#### Example:

### **Slingcode**

#### created by Chris McCormick

#### https://slingcode.net

#### announcement June 23, 2020
##### "It's a web based IDE with live-reloading which you can use to make, run, and share web apps. Made it for my kids but I hope it'll be useful to non-kid amateurs & maybe even pros."

#### Evocative description of Tidal by Scott Wehman:
##### Tidal is an invitation, a map with many areas marked "here be dragons…"
It's a master carpenter's tool kit, but, also a heap of unorganized Legos. Tidal is a playground where both discovery and questions arise simultaneously. It's an intriguing, frustrating mute, a sly cipher, a breathing mandala, a dose of friendly venom. It's a supreme blank slate, a piece of graph paper with a Z axis. A series of amusements and also wretched dead-ends. Tidal is 101 unexpectedly popping balloons, a lucid dream. It is a bicycle that once you learn to ride it, reveals that it can FLY.

:END:

##### Tidal is the thing I think about almost more often than anything else. It is impressive enough to sufficiently motivate an old man who yells at clouds to learn completely new things (writing code) and learn more about things ignored thus far (music fundamentals).

##### Tidal is amazing: I don't know what it is.
###### https://twitter.com/museical/status/1138867065291452421

##### In February 2016, Jeremy Ruston added this comment about Tidal:
###### I was struck by how these rather nicely expressed words might equally apply to the experience of using #TiddlyWiki. It’s actually somebody talking about a specialised programming language for "live coding" musical performances.

###### I like the idea that TiddlyWiki is part of a tradition of tools that have the quality of being "generative": they are meta-tools let you build other, specialised tools for the task at hand. Other examples would be Microsoft Access and Apple’s Hypercard.

###### I think it’s that quality that gives rise to the hall-of-mirrors sensation of dizzying possibility that has become familiar as people talk about their experience of using TiddlyWiki.

###### What do you think? Does TiddlyWiki feel like that to you? Are there other tools you’ve used that have the same quality? Are there situations where "here be dragons" might scare people off?

## **March 2014 collection of thoughts:**
### 'Code' as literature — Donald Knuth:
#### "Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do… The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style."
##### http://www.literateprogramming.com

### Bertrand Meyer, inventor of the Eiffel programming language, said that programming is a "model of a model" of some part of the world … "Reality is a cousin twice removed."

### The **Glass Bead Game** and its grammar may be the same.

### 

### **My current primary interests:**
#### Javascript language that runs in all modern web browsers and powers remuse
##### TiddlyWiki and Wagn

#### HTML (a declarative markup language, not a programming language per se), its cousin XML, and Wiki markup / Markdown with hypertext

#### Python language invented by Guido van Rossum
##### Sage mathematics system and notebook created by William Stein

##### TiddlyWeb toolkit powering remuse wiki

##### See an excerpt from "The Zen of Python"

#### Wolfram Language announced June 2013, which germinated as __Mathematica__ since the late 1980s

#### Smalltalk language invented by ((5d17dca5-c94d-4590-88a2-0c11395b6bf4)) to realize the #Dynabook

#### Visual and grid-based environments, as an extension of the spreadsheet (Excel, Apple Numbers, Quantrix Modeler)
##### Evolution of __Visi __Calc — declarative visual tables / canvas / spreadsheets

#### APL and J languages invented by ((de2f1c81-037e-4226-a841-77356102d436))

#### Lisp language invented by John McCarthy

### 

### Cascading Style Sheets + Wiki links, tags, and macros
#### Rewrite in a Literate Javascript style à la Donald Knuth’s philosophy – 'code' as literature: program logic embedded in the exposition.

#### Incorporate a Javascript or Python REPL (read-eval-print loop) inside any desired tiddler / node. How can computational expressions best be expressed by non-programmers in a TiddlyWiki?  I am reminded of what Dan Ingalls called **"computational sketches"**.

#### Review dialects or alterations of the Javascript syntax which may work better in the user-facing TiddlyWiki (to address the above feature) – or perhaps would even benefit TiddlyWiki development.

#### Python/Javascript interoperability – would **Python** be a better __user language__ of TiddlyWiki?
##### TiddlySpace, built atop [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com/), a Python toolkit

##### Python + JS = a very good toolbox

##### Ruby is the __user language__ of **Wagn**, and Ruby code is allowed in this system's content "cards" which are the corollary of wiki nodes / "tiddlers".

#### Compare with other wiki 'best practices' and technology, especially Wagn
##### Others include everything2 and Wikipedia / MediaWiki

#### Review scalability, and questions of self-contained vs. cloud-based or a hybrid of the two, and storage in a database

#### Wolfram Alpha interoperability

#### **Sage** science/technology/engineering/math software – look at the tools and electronic notebook interface which evolved around the math packages.

#### A digression about the REPL or programming expressions being evaluated inside the wiki.  I am reminded of the Lisp programming language with its REPL. I don't "speak" Lisp, but its spare syntax and code-as-data philosophy seems compatible with nearly the entire #TiddlyWiki architecture expressed in wiki nodes.

#### 

### I worry: is this just a mishmash in my head of unrelated, overlapping, or incompatible technologies?

## From New York Times [obituary](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dennis-ritchie-programming-trailblazer-dies-at-70.html) October 13, 2011:

### The C programming language, __a shorthand of words, numbers and punctuation,__ is still widely used today, and successors like C++ and Java build on the __ideas, rules and grammar__ that Mr. Ritchie designed.

### Mr. Ritchie, Mr. Thompson and their Bell Labs colleagues were making not merely software but, as Mr. Ritchie once put it, **“a system around which fellowship can form.”**

### Colleagues who worked with Mr. Ritchie were struck by his code — meticulous, clean and concise. His writing, according to Mr. Kernighan, was similar. “There was a remarkable precision to his writing,” Mr. Kernighan said, “no extra words, elegant and spare, much like his code.”
