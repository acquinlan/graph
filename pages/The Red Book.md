title: The Red Book

## From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Book_%28Jung%29):
### __The Red Book__ is a red leather‐bound folio manuscript crafted by the Swiss psychiatrist ((be0d8112-737e-43a8-832d-dd8b048b263a)) between 1915 and about 1930. It recounts and comments upon the author's imaginative experiences between 1913 and 1916, and is based on manuscripts first drafted by Jung in 1914‐15 and 1917.

### The Red Book is now regarded by many as the central work in Jung’s oeuvre __[a term from the Latin __opus__ "a work, labor, exertion" — the source of Italian __opera__, French __oeuvre__, Spanish __obra__.]__ However, it was not published or made otherwise accessible for study until 2009.

### In October 2009, with the cooperation of Jung's estate and after 13 years of exhaustive editorial work by Sonu Shamdasani, __The Red Book: Liber Novus__ was published by W. W. Norton in a facsimile edition, complete with an English translation, a comprehensive introduction written by Shamdasani, three appendices, and over 1500 editorial notes.

### … Biographers and critics have disagreed whether these years in Jung's life should be seen as "a creative illness, a period of introspection, a psychotic break, or simply madness." (Lance Owens)

### Jung referred to his imaginative or visionary venture during these years as "my most difficult experiment."

## In November 1913, at the age of thirty-eight, Jung wrote:
### My soul, my soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you — are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come to you, I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again…

### Do you still know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become so different. And how did I find you? How strange my journey was! What words should I use to tell you on what twisted paths a good star has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost forgotten soul. How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you… My soul, my journey should continue with you. I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.
