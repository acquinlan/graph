## poems collected from Twitter, authored by Samuel Forbes Todd

## 

## 

## [[poetry]] begins
as a vanishing act.

to become nothing
but rain
& the weight of the wind.

to feel
your ribcage collapse,
your spine untangle.

to learn time.

then,
to break yourself open

& let every
twisted, lily-blue
breath of the world
rush into you

until
you are human again.

## 

## you write the world in crimson.

    (do i exist?)
    (am i here?)

you reach down to touch the earth,
hair aflame with horizon,
& answer:

    (       )

you shape me from red clay,
fill me with your breath,
lay your lips against my chest.

    (i feel my heart beating)

## 

## decades pass in shine & shadow,
silver moons & copper suns—

your hands sculpt the light.

i pause
for several lifetimes
& for one,

(painting time in all of its patterns).

autumns rise & fall around us,
forged in gold & gallant maple—

we learn the sighs
of a cold October wind.

## 

## 

## we hold the sky
in our lungs,

a sea of dark sapphire.

above, the cosmos spins
its phantom chords;
the earth thrums below.

we know this music well—

the curious weight of heaven
on our shoulders,

the ruins of love
between our ribs.

when the rain comes,
we learn its song anew.

## 

## 

## from water, the willow
from dirt, the rose
from light, all life
in its glorious throes

from mind, the questions
from matter, the mind:
what divine vestige
stirs matter alive?

:

from love, liberation,
from language, love:
to be free is to flourish;
to speak is enough.

## i
descend
   into
     my
       self

seeking symphonies
of wisdom

but deep within
i find instead
a soft and steady
rhythm

rhythm
rumbling through my river-veins,
forming an
untamed oasis—

^^i learn
my wordless
name^^

in this
enchanted

ka
   ta
      ba
         sis

#### AC Quinlan's response:
##### Thank you for this poem on so many levels — the descent suggested by its clever typesetting, the gift of a new word "katabasis", and the deep, interior meanings:

"rhythm
rumbling through my river-veins"

and this I love especially:

"i learn
my wordless
name"

#### Samuel replied:
##### Thanks so much for this thoughtful comment! I really appreciate it. :) & yes, I first encountered the concept of katabasis a few years ago while reading The Odyssey—a rich & polysemous word

## rewind the
grand unified universe
now
 
our conversations
constellations

come
tumbling
down

our neurons
nebulae

unravel
& bound

to the

   center

where splendor
untempered
resounds:

there
there
in harmonious sound

our solidarity
a singularity

our lost loves
found

## ^^i sieve a self
from many selves
& name just one
my own^^

i speak of
secrets
i should keep

& teach my self
of breath & bone

i dare to carve
a human heart
& call its tortured
hollows home

my eyes ignite
& dawn arrives

:

what is an 'i'
but light
& marrow?

## 

## say your words slip away

whittled to a whisper,
drowned in the deluge
of human endeavor

say they fade forever

brittled from the page,
buried by fibrous tongues of decay

vanishing

unheard
unseen

an unknown dream

still,
i believe—
quiet creations
can roar in beauty

## i am of the fading things

of lingering notes
and shards of day

of leaves that blush
and bashfully
sway

of tired moons
and waning tides

of candle wax
and ember lights

of snailshells
and sunken ships

and then sometimes
on nights like this

i am made
of nothing
but emptiness

## chopin
found it
in the (rain)

vincent in the (stars)

a winter sigh
a soft refrain

the 
splintering
of chords & hearts

. . .

i search for it
in summertime

(this secret
known to gods
& psalms)

but
in the fading
iris-light

i am
content
to look & long

## i know everything about you.

^^how your eyes
reveal an umber music,

how your mind turns
like a symphony^^.

how you long to wake
under blue-lipped stars,

that we might
forget the sunrise together.

love,
let us lie
in this Orphean darkness

for just one breath of eternity.

## i've always

            lost

memories
to moon-melted mist

but you, you

              i

refuse
to forget

:

^^your eyes, umber orchids
your lips, lifted prayers^^
your presence, fluorescence
from deathless sun flares

:

your kiss
coaxes

   mist
       into
          stars.

## in dreams
the kinetic roar of the universe
becomes my mind

^^we share a nameless intimacy
an intricacy
an ever-expanding secret^^

(minds are made of lost memories)
(dark matter holds the cosmos whole)

now i see—
lost memories
are dark matter

holding my
wild mind
together

#### AC Quinlan's response:
##### Beautiful. Several poems you've posted recently gave voice to feelings I've not yet named or brought into focus.

##### In this one, you evoke something that reminds me of ((94430345-32b5-4e01-9ebc-b1c93952c89d)) quoting Emerson (two ripples from the past)…

##### Emerson wrote:
###### "We must admire in man the form of the formless, the concentration of the vast, the house of reason, the cave of memory…"

##### Eiseley added:
###### The cave of memory! It is this, this echoing upheld shell, that enabled Emerson to interpose insignificant transitory man as the counterweight to stars & wasteful galaxies, to say, in fact, that man can carry the chemistry & the distance of a star inside his head.

#### Samuel replied:
##### Thank you so much for this thoughtful feedback! I deeply appreciate it. Emerson is one of the thinkers that has influenced me greatly as I work through the nature of time and memory—his essay “circles” opened a new perspective on existence for me...I’m still sorting through it :)

## today, i toss
my frustrated words
to the sky

& watch them transform
into all the

         h i d  shapes  d e n
in the       c l o u d s

(a cumulo-nimble haiku)
(a sun-dappled Shakespearean sonnet)

& last
but not least

(a downside-up poet
basking
in the sky's
perfect poetry)

## you taught me how
sunlight bows to gravity

how
moonlight drizzles
a quicksilver trance

you taught me the
halogen flicker
of firelight—

valences, oh
how
they shudder & dance

you taught me that
love is gravity

& only now
i see

l'amor,
l'amor che move

il sole e l'altre stelle

the love that moves
the sun & the other stars__

## … ^^revolution smolders
in coals of ressentiment
till bonfires of opium
awaken the Übermensch^^
### 
#### AC Quinlan's response:
##### Revisiting your past poems today… you taught me a new word, "ressentiment".

Lots to ponder in that concept:
a psychological state arising from suppressed feelings of envy & hatred that cannot be acted upon, __frequently resulting in some form of self-abasement__.

and Übermensch!

#### Yes! I was borrowing from several sources here, mainly [[Marx]] and Nietzsche! I was fortunate enough to study some of Nietzsche’s work on morality a few years ago. His concept of “ressentiment” went hand in hand with some of Marx’s revolutionary sentiment—at least in my head :)

### out there
in the silence
the poet must listen

to the generous lilies
the invisible wind

out there
in the silence
the poet must worship

the breaking of waves
the unbroken horses

she must dismiss
the towers
of gilded
wise men—

only then
may the poet
become human again

## stifle the sirens
of harsh necessity

uncage,
at last,
your sorrowful song

meet me
where lightning
lays waste
to sophistry

that we
might learn
a love undrawn

———

now test,
my dear,
the waters of reason:

better to gain
one breath of freedom

than life eternal
in loveless eden

## i am the howling white wolf
the black beak of the finch
(& even the tucked tail
of the tiniest rat)

we are beings
raised up
by natural descent

our hearts
& wings
break & beat
rhythmically

^^there is grandeur in this view of life^^

i will breathe into it
as it has breathed into me

#### @RHwriting response:
##### Darwin and poetry, two of my favourite things!!! This is gorgeous!!!! Have you ever listened to 'Mother of mysteries' by Mark Erelli for Darwin Song Project? It is a beautiful song and also includes this quote, worth a listen

##### Let me know what you think! If you enjoy it I recommend listening to the whole album... We're All Leaving by Karine Polwart (also the Darwin song project) is also breathtaking but devastating at the same time

#### Samuel replied:
##### Oh my, what a wonderful song!! I really enjoyed it (and that guitar intro is so good). "there is grandeur in this view of life / where one becomes many through struggle and strife"—powerful!! I can't wait to check out the rest of the album :)

## i know nothing
but shadows

a ballet of mirages
a blissful arabesque

in this cave
the sun & sky
are foreigners

but my fingertips
can trace
the chains between us
until they find your hand

& together
we'll watch the shadows dance
& learn

how [[art]]
can lie
so beautifully

## i write you
at dusk,

as the poetry sleeps.

(tonight, orchids purple the sky.)

our lungs
lightly rise,

then fall into youth—

our ribs curve slow
like memories.

& we ask
of this world

    (is breath more than an echo?)

the light answers soft,
cherry-red on your

      lips.

haunted by a beauty glimpsed
he hunted under leaf and spill
