### see the Twitter search [@ConversingWith L'Engle](https://twitter.com/search?q=@ConversingWith%20L'Engle&f=live) for one such "conversation"

## 

## Within #Roam, I use this list to collect nodes for each person I want to preserve in my knowledge graph, with a sample of their life work and ideas.

## 

## Over time, my plan was to add 500 more people, discovered while I dialogue with each of the first 500, one by one.

#### 
##### Look! Here I am, caught up in this fragment of chronology, in this bit of bone and flesh and water which makes up my mortal body, and yet I am also part of that which is not imprisoned in time or mortality. Partaker simultaneously of the finite and the infinte, I do not find the infinite by repudiating my finiteness, but by being fully in it, in this me who is more than I know. This me, like all of creation, lives in a glorious dance of communion with all the universe. In isolation we die; in interdependence we live.
###### – __A Stone for a Pillow: Journeys with Jacob__, page 90.

##### The challenge I face with children is the redemption of adulthood. We must make it evident that maturity is the fulfillment of childhood and adolescence, not a diminishing; that it is an affirmation of life, not a denial; that it is entering fully into our essential selves.
###### – __The Circle of Quiet__, page 106.

##### …I always look at one person or one thing in particular…I look at one blossom on the bough. One little lizard sunning itself on the wall. One orange. One drop of rain as it slides down the windowpane. When I look at one more carefully, then I know all better.

#### **Rainer Maria Rilke** (4 December 1875 – 29 December 1926) Austrian-born poet; birth name was René Karl Wilhelm Josef Maria Rilke. His verse, often marked by mystic lyricism and vivid imagery, profoundly influenced 20th century German literature and philosophy. His collections include __The Book of Hours__ (1905) and __The Duino Elegies__ (1923), and he also wrote more than 400 poems in French. Died in Switzerland.

##### __Rose, oh reiner Widerspruch,
Lust,
niemandes Schlaf zu sein
unter soviel Lidern__

##### __Oh rose, pure puzzlement in your desire
to not be anyone’s sleep
beneath so many eyelids
(so many songs).__

#### 

#### Self-Portrait 1906
##### translation by [A. S. Kline](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/German/Rilkemorepoems.htm#anchor_Toc69792646)

##### 

##### Certainty there, in the eyelids’ shape,
Of some ancient, long-ennobled race.
Childhood’s anxious blue still in the eyes,
And here and there, humility, not a fool’s
Yet a servant’s though, and feminine.
The mouth’s, a mouth, large and exact,
Unconvinced, but speaking out for
Justice. The brow’s without guile,
Gladly gazing down to quiet shadows.

##### 

##### This, its context’s barely suspected:
Neither in adversity nor success
To gather to precise penetration:
Yet serious reality’s being planned,
As if with scattered Things, from afar.

#### 

#### from __The Sonnets to Orpheus__
##### Though we are unaware of our true status,
our actions stem from pure relationship.
Far away, antennas hear antennas
and the empty distances transmit . . .

##### Pure readiness. O unheard starry music!
Isn't your sound protected from all static
by the ordinary business of our days?

##### In spite of all the farmer's work and worry,
he can't reach down to where the seed is slowly
transmuted into summer. The earth bestows.

#### 

#### On the mountains of the heart
##### On the mountains of the heart cast out to die. Look, how small there,

##### look: the last village of words, and higher,

##### but how small too, yet one last

##### farmstead of feeling. Do you see it?

##### On the mountains of the heart cast out to die. Rockground

##### under the hands. Here, it's true,

##### some things flourish; out of mute downplunge

##### an unknowing herb breaks forth singing.

##### But for the one who knows? Ah, who began to know

##### and now is silent, on the mountains of the heart left to die.

##### True, many an unhurt consciousness roams here,

##### many, so many sure mountain animals

##### change fields and stay. And the great sheltered bird

##### circles the peaks' pure refusal. —But

##### unsheltered, here on the mountains of the heart . . .

##### 

##### __Irschenhausen, September 20, 1914__

#### 

#### I love the dark hours of my being
##### I love the dark hours of my being.
My mind deepens into them.
There I can find, as in old letters,
the days of my life, already lived,
and held like a legend, and understood.

##### Then the knowing comes: I can open
to another life that’s wide and timeless.

##### So I am sometimes like a tree
rustling over a gravesite
and making real the dream
of the one its living roots
embrace:

##### a dream once lost
among sorrows and songs.

##### 

##### This book entered my life as a gift from my friend ((3bb5e0cd-75e5-4339-88b7-6b7fc701a1aa)). It's a book that shaped my view of the world. I later learned that ((0983be4b-051d-4013-9e7a-c9be271d8731)) also admired it, and I can see its influence in his poetry.

##### 

##### Excerpts:
###### Walk tiptoe on the edge of the insatiable precipice and struggle to give order to your vision. Raise the multicolored trap door of the mystery—the stars, the sea, men and ideas; give form and meaning to the formless, the mindless infinitude. Gather together in your heart all terrors, recompose all details

### Carl Jung
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:be0d8112-737e-43a8-832d-dd8b048b263a
:END:
#### **Carl (Gustav) Jung** (26 July 1875 – 6 June 1961) Swiss psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology, whose works include __The Psychology of the Unconscious__ (1912) and __Psychological Types__ (1921). Among his contributions to understanding of the human mind are the concepts of extraversion and introversion, archetypes, and the collective unconscious.

#### After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that a series of "visions", "fantasies", or "imaginations" (his own terms) he had experienced and recorded were not only of personal relevance — but entwined with a larger cultural moment __(or a reality spanning multiple times and cultures.)__ In 1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from his journals, along with additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into a privately held manuscript which became **Liber Novus**: [[The Red Book]].

#### Citing Wikipedia, "Jung took interest in the possible universal nature of the imagery of the [[I Ching]], and he wrote the introduction to an influential German translation by Richard Wilhelm by discussing his theories of archetypes and synchronicity. Jung wrote:
##### 'Even to the most biased eye, it is obvious that this book represents one long admonition to careful scrutiny of one's own character, attitude, and motives.' 

##### The book had a notable impact on the 1960s counterculture and on 20th century cultural figures such as ((287730a9-250b-4229-a0f2-53981f1f5810)), ((537b1e19-a80f-46df-abc2-a03f87785f1c)), ((b7ecd0a7-e6f1-4f4f-a008-93aa2684b5b5)), and ((e128b7d6-f5f0-4824-9b61-2811da8b933f))."

#### **Martin Buber** (8 February 1878 – 13 June 1965) Austrian-born Jewish philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue. In his existentialist work __Ich und Du [I and Thou]__ (1923), he argued that religious experience involves reciprocal relationships with a personal subject, rather than knowledge of some "thing."

#### 

#### From __The Way of Man__:
##### The world awaits hallowing; it awaits the disclosure and realization of its meaning. But we must begin. Meet the world with the fullness of your being, and you shall meet God … If you wish to believe, love!

##### There is something that can only be found in one place. It is a great treasure, which may be called the fulfillment of existence. The place where this treasure can be found is the place on which one stands.

#### 

#### Martin Buber criticized ((d12ec324-8f01-4512-9b19-7e124dd3d248))'s "transtheistic position" as a reduction of God to the impersonal "necessary being" of ((020df735-bdba-48f1-9b1b-747159ec874c)).

#### 

#### "Power and Love" (1926):
##### Every morning

##### I shall concern myself anew about the boundary

##### Between the love-deed-Yes

##### and the power-deed-No,

##### And pressing forward honor reality.

##### We cannot avoid

##### Using power,

##### Cannot escape the compulsion

##### To afflict the world,

##### So let us, cautious in diction

##### And mighty in contradiction,

##### Love powerfully.

#### [NYTimes Obituary: Martin Buber, Renowned Jewish Philosopher](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0208.html)

#### 

#### Buber's interpretation of the Hasidic tradition, however, has been criticized by Chaim Potok for its romanticization. In the introduction to Buber's __Tales of the Hasidim__, Potok notes that Buber overlooked Hasidism's "charlatanism, obscurantism, internecine quarrels, its heavy freight of folk superstition and pietistic excesses, its tzadik worship, its vulgarized and attenuated reading of Lurianic Kabbalah."  Even more severe is the criticism that Buber deemphasized the importance of the Jewish Law in Hasidism.

#### **Walt Whitman** (31 May 1819 – 26 March 1892) was an American journalist and poet, most famous for his lifelong work on his book __Leaves of Grass__.

#### 

#### __You shall possess the origin of all poems…__

#### 

#### In each old song bequeathed — in every noble page or text,
(Different — something unreck'd before —  some unsuspected author,)
In every object, mountain, tree, and star — in every birth and life,
As part of each — evolved from each — meaning, behind the ostent,
A mystic cipher waits infolded.

#### After a long, long course, hundreds of years, denials,
Accumulations, roused love and joy and thought,
Hopes, wishes, aspirations, ponderings, victories, myriads of readers,
Coating, compassing, covering — after ages' and ages' encrustations,
Then only may these songs reach fruition.
##### — Walt Whitman, __Leaves of Grass__

#### 

#### I DREAM’D in a dream, I saw a city
invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth;
I dream’d that was the new City of Friends;
Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love—it led the rest;
It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,
And in all their looks and words.

#### 

#### Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me…
For it the nebula cohered to an orb…
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers…
Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.

#### The two old, simple problems ever intertwined,
Close home, elusive, present, baffled, grappled.
By each successive age insoluble, pass'd on,
To ours to-day — and we pass on the same.
##### — Walt Whitman, "Life and Death," Leaves of Grass

#### 

#### from "Passage to India":
##### Down from the gardens of Asia, descending, radiating,

##### Adam and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them,

##### Wandering, yearning, curious — with restless explorations,

##### With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish — with never-happy hearts,

##### With that sad, incessant refrain, __Wherefore, unsatisfied soul?__ and __Whither, O mocking life?__

His designs included many private homes, such as Fallingwater (1935-39), and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City (1956-1959). His "prairie-style" and Usonian houses, characterized by a close relationship among building, landscape, and materials used, revolutionized domestic architecture in the U.S. Founded the Taliesin Fellowship and died in Scottsdale, Arizona.

#### 

#### [NYTimes Obituary: Frank Lloyd Wright Dies; Famed Architect Was 89](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0608.html)

#### 

#### Man takes a positive hand in creation whenever he puts a building upon the earth beneath the sun. If he has a birthright at all, it must consist in this: that he, too, is no less a feature of the landscape than the rocks, trees, bears, or bees of that nature to which he owes his being.... The sum of man's creative impulses, we find, took substance in architecture as his creative passion rose and fell within it.

#### **Maria Montessori** (31 August 1870 – 6 May 1952) Italian physician and educator who proposed a method of teaching young children that stresses the development of initiative and natural abilities and which was child-centered. Her most well-known book was __The Montessori Method__ (1909). She envisioned education in its entirety from birth to adulthood, and as the prime vehicle for social change. Died in The Netherlands.

#### 

#### Montessori wrote:
##### Since it has been seen to be necessary to give so much to the child, let us give him a vision of the whole universe... If the idea of the universe be presented to the child in the right way, it will do more for him than just arouse his interest, for it will create in him admiration and wonder, a feeling loftier than any interest and more satisfying. The child's mind then will no longer wander, but becomes fixed and can work. The knowledge he then acquires is organized and systematic; his intelligence becomes whole and complete because of the vision of the whole that has been presented to him, and his interest spreads to all, for all are linked and have their place in the universe on which his mind is centred. The stars, earth, stones, life of all kinds form a whole in relation with each other, and so close is this relation that we cannot understand a stone without some understanding of the great sun! No matter what we touch, an atom, or a cell, we cannot explain it without knowledge of the wide universe. What better answer can be given to those seekers for knowledge? It becomes doubtful whether even the universe will suffice. How did it come into being, and how will it end? A greater curiosity arises, which can never be satiated; so will last through a lifetime. The laws governing the universe can be made interesting and wonderful to the child, more interesting even than things in themselves, and he begins to ask: What am I? What is the task of man in this wonderful universe? Do we merely live here for ourselves, or is there something more for us to do?

He won the 1946 Nobel Prize for literature for __The Glass Bead Game__ [__Magister Ludi__]. Died in Switzerland.

#### From the [[Glass Bead Game]]:
##### Everything is contradictory, everything tangential; there are no certainties anywhere. Everything can be interpreted one way and then again interpreted in the opposite sense … Isn't there any truth? Is there no real and valid doctrine?

##### The Master had never heard him speak so fervently. He walked on in silence for a little, then said,  ^^"There is truth, my boy. But the doctrine you desire, absolute, perfect dogma that alone provides wisdom, does not exist. Nor should you long for a perfect doctrine, my friend. Rather, you should long for the perfection of yourself. The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived, not taught.^^  Be prepared for conflicts, Joseph Knecht — I can see they have already begun."

#### "Every one of us is a hidden child. We are hidden in our beginnings—in the vagaries of the genetic cards that have been dealt to us by nature; we are hidden in the episodes of our individual lives, environments, events unduplicable that have aided or scarred us. We may have come from poverty or riches, but ironically this tells us nothing either, for on occasion it may be the rich child who has suffered trauma and the poor one who has achieved insight and balance. It is not always so … I merely say to begin with that life is infinitely complex and hidden. We share together some elements of a complicated culture and a language, which, while common to all of us, whispers to each of us secret meanings, depending upon the lives we have led. Our diverging roads begin before birth and intensify afterwards."

The White Whale was the ancient Ark.
You be the New.
Forty days, __forty moons,__ forty years,

You see. The Universe is blind.
You touch. The Abyss does not feel.
You hear. The Void is dear.
Your wife is pomegranate. The stars are lifeless and bereft.
You smell the Wind of Being.
On windless worlds the nostrils of old Time are stuffed
With dust and worse than dust.
Settle it with your lust, shape it with your seeing,
Rain it with your sperming seed,
Water it with your passion,
Show it your need.
Soon or late,
Your mad example may imitate.

###### **Notes:**  The figurative sense of a 'Great White Whale' is in reference to the white sperm whale hunted by Captain Ahab in ((3a4337a7-be43-4f88-8c0e-b01e2ca4ca3f))'s novel __Moby Dick__ (1851) … signifying an objective earnestly or relentlessly pursued; the object of an obsession. This obsession completely encircles and defines the person in its grip, threatening to destroy him.

:END:
#### This is a prepared text of the Commencement address delivered by Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Computer and of Pixar Animation Studios, on June 12, 2005:
##### I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.

##### The first story is about connecting the dots.

##### I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?

##### It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.

##### And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

##### It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:

##### Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.

##### None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

##### Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

##### My second story is about love and loss.

##### I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

##### I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

##### I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

##### During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

##### I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.

##### My third story is about death.

##### When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

##### Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

##### About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

##### I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.

##### This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

##### No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

##### Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

##### When I was young, there was an amazing publication called __The Whole Earth Catalog__, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960’s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

##### Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

##### Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

##### Thank you all very much.

#### 

#### From "[Remembering Ken Iverson](http://keiapl.info/rhui/remember.htm)" by Roger Hui, November 2004:
##### As others have recounted, Ken was deeply interested in words, their use and their etymology. He indeed did read the dictionary, and kept a copy of the American Heritage Dictionary (along with other dictionaries) by his easy chair for ready reference. He especially encouraged me to consult the section on Indo-European roots in the back of the AHD, which makes deep and uncommon connections between words.

##### Many of Ken’s relatives and friends received from him the AHD as a present. I myself did not because I’d already owned one years before I met Ken. In fact, I gave him the third edition of the AHD as a present.

##### I think nothing I had ever done impressed Ken quite as much as when I found the word “rhematic” (meaning, pertaining to the formation of words), a word he had been searching for for some time. Thus the phrase “rhematic rules of J” made its way into the J [programming language] dictionary.

    And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

##### And for all this, nature is never spent;
    There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
And though the last lights off the black West went
    Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs —
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
    World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.

#### All things counter, original, spare, strange;
Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)
With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:
Praise him.

##### **IN FACT**

###### Because everything is still scary, including you. Because__ being here__ and __doing this__ scare the fuck out of me, and that, as ever, is exactly why I need to. Because I’m fighting not to let my disabilities and mental illnesses define me. Because I spent years living in my bed and I need to stand and I need to shout. [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL0tnrl2L_U) the world is round, it turns me on. Because I’m struggling financially as I’ve never struggled before and I need enough people to give a damn about me and my work again to make money at it. Because I always have and always will keep doing it either way because it’s my best therapy. Because if I can’t hop back on this ride and __stay__ here this time, I know I’ll never come back. Because in the 6-8 years (in various forms) that I’ve been off the web, the world’s became a place I fear (and fear __for__) far greater than my capacity to comprehend it, and that’s got me __ornery.__ Because I’ve lost too much not to hold on to what I’ve got left by my trembling fingernails. Because the chorus is singing in mourning and in hope and I want to be part of it. Because I may not leave my home but I’m sure as hell looking out the windows. Because now more than ever, [we must love one another or die](https://poets.org/poem/september-1-1939). Because I need to find out if I still __can__, to any and every part of all of the above.

#### From __Letters of Ted Hughes__ quoted by [[Brain Pickings]]:
##### When I came to Lake Victoria, it was quite obvious to me that in some of the most important ways you are much more mature than I am. . . . But in many other ways obviously you are still childish — how could you not be, you alone among mankind? It’s something people don’t discuss, because it’s something most people are aware of only as a general crisis of sense of inadequacy, or helpless dependence, or pointless loneliness, or a sense of not having a strong enough ego to meet and master inner storms that come from an unexpected angle. But not many people realise that it is, in fact, the suffering of the child inside them. Everybody tries to protect this vulnerable two three four five six seven eight year old inside, and to acquire skills and aptitudes for dealing with the situations that threaten to overwhelm it. So everybody develops a whole armour of secondary self, the artificially constructed being that deals with the outer world, and the crush of circumstances. And when we meet people this is what we usually meet. And if this is the only part of them we meet we’re likely to get a rough time, and to end up making ‘no contact’. But when you develop a strong divining sense for the child behind that armour, and you make your dealings and negotiations only with that child, you find that everybody becomes, in a way, like your own child. It’s an intangible thing. But they too sense when that is what you are appealing to, and they respond with an impulse of real life, you get a little flash of the essential person, which is the child. Usually, that child is a wretchedly isolated undeveloped little being. It’s been protected by the efficient armour, it’s never participated in life, it’s never been exposed to living and to managing the person’s affairs, it’s never been given responsibility for taking the brunt. And it’s never properly lived. That’s how it is in almost everybody. And that little creature is sitting there, behind the armour, peering through the slits. And in its own self, it is still unprotected, incapable, inexperienced. Every single person is vulnerable to unexpected defeat in this inmost emotional self. At every moment, behind the most efficient seeming adult exterior, the whole world of the person’s childhood is being carefully held like a glass of water bulging above the brim. And in fact, that child is the only real thing in them. It’s their humanity, their real individuality, the one that can’t understand why it was born and that knows it will have to die, in no matter how crowded a place, quite on its own. That’s the carrier of all the living qualities. It’s the centre of all the possible magic and revelation. What doesn’t come out of that creature isn’t worth having, or it’s worth having only as a tool — for that creature to use and turn to account and make meaningful. So there it is. And the sense of itself, in that little being, at its core, is what it always was. But since that artificial secondary self took over the control of life around the age of eight, and relegated the real, vulnerable, supersensitive, suffering self back into its nursery, it has lacked training, this inner prisoner. And so, wherever life takes it by surprise, and suddenly the artificial self of adaptations proves inadequate, and fails to ward off the invasion of raw experience, that inner self is thrown into the front line — unprepared, with all its childhood terrors round its ears. And yet that’s the moment it wants. That’s where it comes alive — even if only to be overwhelmed and bewildered and hurt. And that’s where it calls up its own resources — not artificial aids, picked up outside, but real inner resources, real biological ability to cope, and to turn to account, and to enjoy. That’s the paradox: the only time most people feel alive is when they’re suffering, when something overwhelms their ordinary, careful armour, and the naked child is flung out onto the world. That’s why the things that are worst to undergo are best to remember. But when that child gets buried away under their adaptive and protective shells—he becomes one of the walking dead, a monster. So when you realise you’ve gone a few weeks and haven’t felt that awful struggle of your childish self — struggling to lift itself out of its inadequacy and incompetence — you’ll know you’ve gone some weeks without meeting new challenge, and without growing, and that you’ve gone some weeks towards losing touch with yourself. The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn’t live boldly enough, that they didn’t invest enough heart, didn’t love enough. Nothing else really counts at all.

#### Correspondances
##### Nature is a temple where living pillars
Let escape sometimes confused words;
Man traverses it through forests of symbols
That observe him with familiar glances.

##### Like long echoes that intermingle from afar
In a dark and profound unity,
Vast like the night and like the light,
The perfumes, the colors and the sounds respond.

##### There are perfumes fresh like the skin of infants
Sweet like oboes, green like prairies,
—And others corrupted, rich and triumphant

##### That have the expanse of infinite things,
Like ambergris, musk, balsam and incense,
Which sing the ecstasies of the mind and senses.

##### 
###### Commentary:
####### Baudelaire’s “Doctrine of Correspondences” suggests a belief of sorts in a pattern for the world and in relationships between the physical world and a spiritual one. This view, probably influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg and viewed as an antecedent to symbolism, is presented in the poem “Correspondances.”

####### Nature is presented as a “temple” whose living pillars speak to man and whose “forest of symbols” (__forêt de symboles__) observe him. Baudelaire writes that __“Les parfums, les couleurs, et les sons se répondent”__ (Perfumes, colors, and sounds interact with each other) like echoes in a __“ténébreuse et profonde unité”__ (dark and deep unity). Although he does not include a direct expression of faith in God or gods in the poem, Baudelaire’s profoundly mystical belief in the world’s fundamental unity is clear. “Correspondances” epitomizes Baudelaire’s complicated spirituality.

##### All forms of love, suffering, madness: he searches himself; he consumes all the poisons in himself, to keep only their quintessence… Let him die charging among those unutterable, unnameable things: other fearful workers will come: they’ll start from the horizons where the first have fallen! …

##### To find a language – for that matter, all words being ideas, the age of a universal language will come! This language will be of the soul for the soul, containing everything: scents, sounds, colours, thought attaching to thought and pulling…

##### These poets will exist! When woman’s endless servitude is broken, when she lives for and through herself, when man – previously abominable – has granted her freedom, she too will be a poet! Women will discover the unknown! Will her world of ideas differ from ours? – She will discover strange things, unfathomable; repellent, delicious: we will take them to us, we will understand them.

##### Meanwhile, let us demand __new things__ from the __poets__ – ideas and forms. All the clever ones will think they can easily satisfy this demand: that’s not so!

#### On rare occasions there comes along a profound original, an odd little book that appears out of nowhere, from the pen of some obscure storyteller, and once you have read it, you will never go completely back to where you were before. The kind of book you might hesitate to lend for fear you might miss its company. The kind of book that echoes from the heart of some ancient knowing, and whispers from time’s forgotten cave that life may be more than it seems, and less.
##### John E. Simpson researched the origin of this passage (see [here](https://johnesimpson.com/blog/2019/02/read-the-hints-come-at-last/#note)), concluding:
###### This isn’t a quote from Banfield’s “Beachcomber” book; it’s a __blurb__ for Banfield’s book.

#### A creditable critical tradition detects not one, but at least two __Moby-Dick__s: the sea adventure Melville set out to write, and the intellectual adventure generated by his encounter, in mid-composition, with Hawthorne and Shakespeare. Both __Moby-Dick__s, however, coexist within one book. As in the oral tradition, the new version does not replace the earlier ones, but aligns itself alongside or on top of them, creating a "formless" text that has bewildered generations of conventional critics.

##### Bartleby is a scrivener—a kind of clerk or a copyist—"who obstinately refuses to go on doing the sort of writing demanded of him." During the spring of 1851, Melville felt similarly about his work on __Moby-Dick__. Thus, Bartleby may represent Melville's frustration with his own situation as a writer, and the story itself is "about a writer who forsakes conventional modes because of an irresistible preoccupation with the most baffling philosophical questions." Bartleby may also be seen to represent Melville's relation to his commercial, democratic society.

### Karl Marx
#### From "[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm)" by Karl Marx (1852)
##### Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.

##### … **The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot take its poetry from the past but only from the future.**  It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped away all superstition about the past.
###### __Note:__  Brumaire was the second month of the French Republican calendar (1793–1805), originally running from October 22 to November 20.
Marx's title refers to the [Coup of 18 Brumaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_of_18_Brumaire) in which Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in revolutionary France (on November 9, 1799, or 18 [Brumaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumaire) Year VIII in the French Republican Calendar.)
####### See my November 10th entry "((d0ba4480-b6eb-41e0-8cfb-de1eb9a957b5))".

#### "[Karl Marx, Yesterday and Today](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/karl-marx-yesterday-and-today)" by Louis Menand (October 2016)

#### 

#### In ((b8c7fbc3-a94d-4fd0-8551-c99e0f2ab4b0))' novel __The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter__, Marx is described in the voice of a character Dr. Benedict Copeland:
##### Karl Marx was a wise man. He studied and worked and understood the world around him. He said that the world was divided into two classes, the poor and the rich. For every rich man there were a thousand poor people who worked for this rich man to make him richer. He did not divide the world into Negroes or white people or Chinese—to Karl Marx it seemed that being one of the millions of poor people or one of the few rich was more important to a man than the color of his skin.

##### The life mission of Karl Marx was to make all human beings equal and to divide the great wealth of the world so that there would be no poor or rich and each person would have his share. This is one of the commandments Karl Marx left to us: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

##### … His thoughts were not concerned with Heaven or the future of the dead. His mission was for the living. For the great masses of human beings who work and suffer and work until they die.

#### The Wall
##### 

##### Imagine yourself standing in front of a big brick wall. Just you and the wall. How close do you stand? And what do you feel when you are facing the wall?

##### How wide is your wall? And how high? Can you see where the wall ends? Where it begins? Can you reach the top?

##### How old is the wall—or how new? Who built it? And why? How long have you been here? Are you alone? How long do you plan to say?

##### It’s your wall, you know. Touch it. Feel its texture. Feel whatever you feel.

##### What is on the other side of the wall? Can you guess? Do you know? Have you ever been there? Do you want to go there now?

##### What if you are not alone? What if there is more here than just you and the wall? What if we are there with you?

##### What if you are wrong about the strength of the wall? What if you are wrong about your own potential? You’ve been wrong before, haven’t you?

##### You wall is made of bricks—individual bricks. The wall is big. The bricks are small. The mortar is of your own making. How strong is it?

##### What if you destroy your wall? What if you destroy your wall, and then regret it? What if you miss it? What if you can’t handle it on the other side of the wall? What if it’s too late to turn back now?

##### Now put your hand on your wall. Touch it, palm flat on the wall. What happens? Push. What happens? Both hands. What happens?

##### Will you step through? Do you dare? Can you keep yourself from it? Can you let yourself stumble, and laugh when you fall through to the other side of …? What’s left of the wall?

##### What is it like on this side of the wall? The sky, the ground, the air around you—what is it like? What do you see? What do you hear? And what do you feel?

##### And what’s that in the distance?

#####

##### …Instruction in computer use was part of ordinary education; in the Valley this principally involved learning TOK. A convenient side-effect of this was the use of TOK — which could be spoken as well as typed into the Exchange terminals — as a worldwide lingua franca for traders and travellers and people wishing to communicate with people of another language directly or through the Exchanges. In the Valley, in fact, this use of TOK rather overshadowed its original purpose. But anybody who was interested in working with the terminal could augment their training at will. The City would provide training on any level, from simple gameplaying to the heights of pure mathematics or theoretical physics, for anyone desiring to master some part of the infinite complexities of information retrieval. The Memory of the City of Mind was incalculably vast. Endless knowledge was there, if one could get at it; for the goal of the Mind was to become a total mental model or replica of the Universe.

Johnson coined the term “moticos” in 1955, claiming that he and his friend, photographer Norman Solomon, chose “osmotic” at random out of a dictionary. Johnson presumably liked the term’s connotation of fluidity, however. He used it to refer to many elements of his practice, from the small tesserae-like pieces in his collages to his short, memoir-like stories and poems. He returned to his collages many times over the course of years, using these moticos and other found materials to bring together people, text, and images, positing new connections between what were often seemingly unrelated subjects. Johnson did not juxtapose these things arbitrarily: he purposefully chose and placed the elements within his compositions.

##### Johnson said: "They're really collages – paste-ups of pictures and pieces of paper… but that sounds too much like what they really are, so I call them moticos. It's a good word because it's both singular and plural and you can 
pronounce it how you like."

##### He used the moticos glyphs as textual stand-ins or referents to other texts or images in his work. Through this practice, Johnson developed an extensive, ever-mutating vocabulary for his collages.

### May Wilson and son William S. (Bill) Wilson
#### The son of assemblage artist [May Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Wilson), Bill was deeply involved in the post-war New York art world, the subject of his numerous published essays.

#### He published a collection of short stories, __Why I Don’t Write Like Franz Kafka__ (1975), and the novel __Birthplace__ (1982).

#### On ((61b86d36-247d-46ed-98b0-ec5fffa95512)):
##### When he sent works of art through the mail to people as gifts, he was describing what he thought were the correct relations among people…

##### An envelope from Ray was like a haiku, a moment of immediacy and indeterminancy, a particularly vivid moment outside the economy, outside the machinery of our culture. It was free.
