title: Knowledge OS
---

## It's morning. You awake refreshed and head into your study to start the day. Morning sunlight slants through the window.

You sit at your desktop and enter your web-based knowledge worker OS.

What apps do you see?
What do you need to set you up and get through the day?

## AC Quinlan:

## I start with what I find essential, needed in week 1 of use with my Knowledge OS — [[Codex]] envisioned as a vital part.  I then describe additional tools and features built over time, expanding its power incrementally. My approach favors “little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.”

## My ideal Knowledge OS inherits a variety of content and use cases from #TiddlyWiki, and the two may possibly integrate and cross-pollinate each other.  I have historic and genealogy research scattered across other software platforms, and about 20 years of creative writing.

## The contents of my last major wiki date back to 2011 — with a small portion migrated to the newest version of TW, and some to #Roam.

### Login to my own workspace / environment
#### Public/private access at the workspace and node levels

#### White room. One wall: 'Welcome to the World.'
##### (Phrase by @NormanChella, tweet here)
###### https://twitter.com/NormanChella/status/1326034415001067521

#### I also imagine the Oculus VR headset’s spatial quality of its starting room.

### 

### Other resources open in my browser, cross-feeding with Codex:
#### Email, Twitter, Google Docs / Drive, Google Books, Dictionaries & Wikipedia

### 

### __Later development:__
#### Transclude / import from other workspaces
##### Refer to the TiddlySpace “bags” functionality

##### If one TiddlySpace wiki imported another, all its nodes were included, and editing in the second wiki essentially "forked" a second version of the node. 

##### Also could link to other user's wiki nodes, aka "tiddlers" in TW
###### I can't recall the TiddlySpace implementation in detail — example follows:
####### The "sentence" and "grammar" nodes of my wiki (see [here](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#sentence%20grammar%20%40vikram-rao)) also existed in the [vikram-rao](https://web.archive.org/web/20161209214225/http://vikram-rao.tiddlyspace.com/) TiddlySpace
######## Display the underlying wikitext of the "sentence" node:
######### expressing a self-intelligible unit of thought, i.e. a [[unity]]@vikram-rao that can stand by itself without requiring anything else
########## /![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fsensemaking%2FpuuehhTfi0.png?alt=media&token=23d5d87b-6293-44a3-875c-21d75452ec79)

####### (TiddlySpace shut down at the end of 2016; this is a frozen HTML snapshot.)

### 

### **Web-based mobile text editor**
#### Start with the aesthetic of a blank page.
##### (Phrase by @Jeanvaljean689, tweet here)
###### https://twitter.com/Jeanvaljean689/status/1325797240166776832

#### Rich text stylings
##### Italic / bold / underline emphasis, and others — allow overlapping styles

##### Headings, lists, all Markdown and #TiddlyWiki styles

##### Hyperlink styling (internal knowledge graph nodes vs. external links)

##### Broadly available default typefaces (serif, sans serif, fixed width "typewriter")

##### How much CSS control or custom / user defined styles?

#### Likely implemented with standoff properties — but needs to import styled text copied from the OS clipboard, as well as HTML and other text markups.

#### Note: color highlighting, strikethrough, and other styles which **have meaning to the knowledge graph**
##### __need the ability to search by standoff properties / markup / text styling__

#### Utilize the device / platform / web browser resources such as spell checking, voice to text recognition, auto-complete — with a good mobile editing experience.

#### Fine-grained text addressability (down to the block level as in #Roam)
##### Note earlier work done here with [PurpleWiki](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#PurpleWiki) (((4ffdb79e-74a0-4c6d-9d76-d62d7f4af4a1)) & ((47648a4e-7347-40b8-870e-aab778b34d04)))

#### Transclusion of blocks
##### Roam does this well (mostly)

##### Twitter does so in greater scale: retweets & quote tweets

##### /part plugin for TiddlyWiki and /précis method I previously used
###### http://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#précis%20WikiStructure/precis%20ReligiousSearch

#### __Later developments:__
##### Revision history

##### Auto-saving, but possibly handle revision points at a "close/save" step per individual node

##### Ability to tag as drafts (with public/private option)

### 

### **Import knowledge & media into the graph/workspace**
#### Simple import methods taking just a few seconds or UI clicks/taps — capturing from the web browser on all devices, as well as photos, screenshots, email, drag & drop from desktop apps or filesystem.

#### Edit, annotate, and present text with markup, standoff properties, and hyperlinks

#### __The most important attribute of a wiki is that it elevates linking to be part of the punctuation of writing.__
##### –Jeremy Ruston

#### ^^Relationship linking, entities, attributes, and other features in the Codex beta^^  (this is key)

#### Questions to ponder from @[CodexEditor](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1325772420154716160?):
##### How do you want to see your media related? Do you have writing which belongs with music? Photos which belong with videos?

##### What makes a text an email, a tweet, a blog post, an SMS?

##### What makes a photo destined for social media, photography platforms, or personal scrapbook?

##### AC Quinlan:
###### I can't locate a tweet I saw recently __(the irony!__) in which someone described their SMS history as the quickest path to locate something…

###### If they can't describe the sought-for item clearly, they can remember the PERSON it was discussed or exchanged with.

###### I can't describe a specific architecture, but it seems that **RELATIONSHIPS** (abstract, human, situational) should be the organizing principle of all our media & information — with an added subtlety of __overlapping__ relationships.

#### 

### **Node / media types**
#### Plain text
##### Multi-representation
###### Styled, paginated, block outline, non-linear, and more representations of underlying text

##### Quotations
###### attribution and links back to context

#### Images
##### stored with transcription and/or captions

##### original image retained with an edited copy (cropped, straightened, retouched)

#### Twitter tweets / threads / queries

#### Wikipedia

#### PDF

#### Audio
##### transcription stored with audio file
###### __Later:__
####### song lyrics, with audio time points mapped to the beginning of each line / verse / chorus, etc.

####### enabling "play from here" triggers within the textual lyrics

#### Videos
##### transcription / subtitles (including text in video frames)

#### External attachments
##### rendered by the web browser, likely in a new tab or iframe

##### still have annotations and graph relationships

#### 

#### __Later developments:__
##### **import conversations** (block-referenced by author) including SMS
###### notify other parties if the node is publicly viewable (in which case, they may import the same conversation to their own knowledge graph)

###### query “in reply to Alan”,  “from Steve”,  “links / pictures / etc. sent to ___”
… and other possibilities

##### **Translations**
###### original text with translations side-by-side

###### crediting the human translator (block-reference each translation version by their name)

###### ability to attach / interpolate multiple translations

###### also utilize machine translations when necessary

##### __Optional (not a current priority to me)__
###### **sketches, drawings** created directly in Codex
####### possible annotation layer on top of other documents?

####### circled, underlined text, lines and arrows drawn on top of a document

####### __Later, when feasible:__
######## store handwriting with OCR text

### 

### **Search**
#### Boolean operators, model after Google and Twitter search syntax

#### Filter by time stamps, author / editor, node or media type, and other attributes

### Story River
#### as implemented by #TiddlyWiki, and extended further
##### [Story River on TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Story%20River:%5B%5BStory%20River%5D%5D%20TiddlyWiki)

#### a single column by default, but at least two side-by-side are available (Roam sidebar is an example)

#### display options:
##### sequence nodes by their last update timestamps

##### sequence nodes by their last view (like a browser history)

##### return to the last view of the workspace

##### or customize the story river contents with filters / queries
###### TiddlyWiki example:
[tag[post]][sort[-modified]][limit[10]]

#### ability to save story streams, as with a TiddlyWiki plugin I used

#### view a focus point (search result, or any node we’ve traveled to) with its surrounding time-based context
##### e.g. 4 nodes [user specified value] before & after the focus point, for 9 total

#### 

### **Email to Codex**
#### retain the sender/recipient information, attachments, and entire threads forwarded to Codex

#### can help establish the digital "provenance" of how information was gained

#### retain flags of how it was received, a "forward" to Codex, a "cc" or "bcc"

#### 

### Editing tools to build timelines / chronologies of historic events
#### nodes are ordered by event or external record (primary source) dates they describe

### Block referencing / text addressing with a navigational vocabulary such as:
#### a document's section or chapter number

#### page number (especially when the material has been published / printed)

#### paragraph, sentence, or line number of a given section, chapter, or page

#### stanza and line numbers within a poem

#### footnotes, endnotes

### Archive.org web snapshots
#### answer to "link rot"

#### allows comparisons of page versions across time

#### save a text snapshot to Codex? (full text searchable)
##### what about archived page images, plugins, Javascript?

### Dictionary / Etymology / Word Tools
#### https://twitter.com/museical/status/1316199550458224640
##### Your phrase “to visualise and coordinate subtle relations between words” reminds me of a capability I’d like to see in my sensemaking tools:

##### …some kind of automated (or semi-automated) linkage between words on the basis of their etymology

##### I’d suggest using the excellent [http://etymonline.com](https://t.co/NwiZt0TvRB?amp=1) as a source.

##### Today I noticed two instances of the word “chord” in my Roam graph. I consulted its etymology and realized its direct relationship to the word “cord” which I’ve used in several other places and appears in passages I’ve collected. I realize that technically this could explode the graph relationships, so there would have to be a way to direct its scope.

##### Mining Etymonline for the phrase “cognate with” would indicate relationships between words from different languages, and their shared linguistic roots. Often I discover and/or appreciate new shades of meaning following this method.

##### More in this thread:
###### @fredgalvao:
I don't think we should worry about exploding the graph internally. All the possible representations, relationships, classifier properties, they all explode easily the graph of an entity <if we try to touch them all at the same time>. The trick is to weigh them before expanding.

## [feature](https://www.etymonline.com/word/feature#etymonline_v_1183) (n.)
### early 14c., "make, form, fashion" (obsolete), from Anglo-French __feture__, from Old French __faiture__ "deed, action; fashion, shape, form; countenance," from Latin __factura__ "a formation, a working," from past participle stem of __facere__ "make, do, perform"
