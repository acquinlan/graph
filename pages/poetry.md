## Who is a poet but a
yearning animal
wading naked
into a secret lake?
What is poetry but the
phosphorescent wake?

## __You shall possess the origin of all poems…__
### ((d3ea883b-e53b-40e6-8e9b-b338d41a5a71)), from __Leaves of Grass__
#### You shall possess the origin of all poems.
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand,
nor look through the eyes of the dead,
nor feed on the spectres in books.
You shall not look through my eyes either,
nor take things from me.
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.

## I learned from Whitman that the poem is a temple—or a green field—a place to enter, and in which to feel. Only in a secondary way is it an intellectual thing, an artifact… I learned that the poem was made not just to exist, but to speak—to be company.

## As a countervailing reality, poetry erects "a temple deep inside our hearing"…

#### I want to step back from the edge, into the vital body, into the life world, and make a more tenable claim for literature. I do so by calling on the poetic generosity of Seamus Heaney…

#### To know poetry, Heaney says, 'is to know and celebrate it not only as a matter of proffered argument and edifying discourse, but as **a matter of angelic potential, a motion of the soul**.'

#### Unabashedly, Heaney speaks the language of spirity; but unabashedly, too, he fingers the **loam of history**.  Indeed, for him the 'frontiers of writing' are those we continually cross and recross, make and unmake, between poetry and politics, between sacred and profane knowledge between the marvellous and the banal… Poetry is 'strong enough to help' (Seferis), respond, and answer 'in its own language rather than in the language of teh world that provokes it …'

#### As a countervailing reality, poetry erects 'a temple deep inside our hearing' (Rilke's phrase), at which we all need to worship in order to save __both__ ourselves and the world.

#### A poem should be equal to:
Not true.

An empty doorway and a maple leaf.

The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—

But be.

## When you're a young poet, reading is a search for your lost family.

## Poetry is eternal graffiti written in the heart of everyone.

## To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work.

## The courage of the poet is to keep ajar the door that leads into madness.

### Paul Laurence Dunbar, from "Dreams"

## 

## … and you communed with insensible arrangements: changeable
organizations; shapeless distractions; puffs of dimension; ampersands;
the dead. I pulled you close and kissed you, but all I could taste
was vortex, and sweet guava, and the distances to.…
### … and we grew thicker together, for I too could perceive, in the dry
expanses, forms of invisible logos made thick — the un-wet language
of communicable waves.

### –look–
selves, stir: writhe
o-p-e-n-i-n-g 

are (leaves; flowers) dreams,

come quickly come
run run
with me now
jump shout (laugh
dance cry
sing) for it's Spring

–irrevocably;
and in
earth sky trees:
:every
where a miracle arrives

(yes)

you and I may not
hurry it with
a thousand poems
my darling
but nobody will stop it
#### (listen) poem # 63 from E.E. Cummings' 1964 collection
