## __The path from inner intensity to greatness leads through sacrifice. – Kassner__

## 

## Und das Gerücht, daß ein __Schauender__ sei,
rührte {{{alias [[LesMinst]]diemindest}}},
fraglicher Sichtbaren,
**rührte die Frauen.**

## …

## And the rumor that a __gazer__ existed
stirred the least clearly,
more questionably visible ones.
**stirred women**.

## …

## He had long won it through gazing.
Stars fell to their knees
under his grappling up-glance.
Or he gazed beseechingly,
and the scent of his urgency
wearied an Immortal,
until it smiled on him from sleep.

## 

## Towers he gazed at with such force
that they were startled
building them up again, abruptly, all in an instant!
But how often the landscape,
overburdened by the day,
rested in his quiet perceiving, at twilight.

## 

## Animals stepped trustingly
into his open gaze as they grazed,
and the caged lions
stared in, as into unthinkable freedom;
birds flew straight through it,
as it made room; flowers
gazed back into it
greatly, as in children.

## …

## Gazing how long?
How long inwardly lacking,
imploring deep down in his glance?
When he, whose vocation was Waiting, sat far from home…
and later from the tormenting bed, again:
there was counsel in the air,
beyond grasping there was counsel
over his still feelable heart,
over his heart which through the buried-alive body
could nevertheless be felt…
it did not have love.

## 

## (And forbade him further consecrations.)

## 

## For the act of gazing sets limits.
And the world gazed at more deeply
wants to flourish in love.

## …

## Work of the eyes is done,
begin heartwork now
on those images in you, those captive ones;
for you conquered them: but even now you don't know them.

## …

## __Werk des Gesichts ist getan,
tue nun Herz-Werk.__

## …

## **Behold, inner man, your inner woman!**
she who was won
from a thousand natures,
the merely attained,
as yet never loved creation.

## 

## In two letters addressed to Lou Andreas-Salomé, the poet wrote:
### Lou, dear, here is a curious poem, written this morning, which I am sending you at once, since I instinctively called it “Turning,” knowing that it represents that turning which surely must come if I am to live, and you will understand its meaning. [Saturday, June 20, 2014]

### With this "Turning," which __is__ one, and yet scarcely one any longer, since it has been on its way for so long, has been prepared for, indeed has already almost arrived. Your body knew of its coming, as it were, before you yourself did, yet in the way that only bodies know of things, — with such infinite innocence and directness that in the end, this knowledge could temporarily create for it a new misunderstanding with the mind.

### Do you know by what sign this revealed itself? By the eyes, — those __gazing__ ones, those wresting to attain that being "as yet never loved," one and the same in a thousand different guises; __they wanted to love,__ **they blasted the boundaries set for them**… [June 24, 2014]
