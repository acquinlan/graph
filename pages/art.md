## ((74b54a3b-e5b6-4a59-80ff-7d0dee5280fd)):
### Art is a discovery and development of elementary principles of nature into beautiful forms suitable for human use.

## ((8109b4dd-c340-422a-8c89-3af24c4573e6)) in __L'art Romantique__:
### [Correspondances are] the affinities which exist between spiritual states and states in nature; those people who are aware of these [[correspondance]]s become artists, and their art is of value only in so far as it is capable of expressing these mysterious relationships.

## ((90111ed9-6d91-4428-9a93-6bcdd107995e)), in his essay “What Is Art?”:
### Art is not, as the metaphysicians say, the manifestation of some mysterious idea of beauty or God; it is not, as the aesthetical physiologists say, a game in which man lets off his excess of stored-up energy; it is not the expression of man’s emotions by external signs; it is not the production of pleasing objects; and, above all, it is not pleasure; but ^^__it is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress toward well-being of individuals and of humanity.__^^

## Susan Sontag:
### "All great art contains at its center contemplation, a dynamic contemplation."
#### (9/10/1964)

## 

## Human effort to imitate, supplement, alter, or counteract the work of nature.

### Years ago, I translated this into Latin root words:
#### __Humanus ex fortis versus natus mori mundi.__
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:36e858fa-b3d3-48eb-911f-d0945b94596f
:END:
##### effort = __ex fortis__ "out" + "strength"

##### counteract = __versus__ (towards, [facing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/versus#Adverb))
###### imitate, supplement, and alter — all forms of that human counteracting

##### "work of nature" = __'natus mori mundi'__ – the world being born and dying
