## The original wiki [C2](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki) created by Ward Cunningham in 1995 describes itself as a "content creation wiki" … and "a composition system, a discussion medium, a repository…a tool for collaboration."  [→](https://wiki.c2.com/?FrontPageDiscussion)

## Cunningham's first wiki software was called WikiWikiWeb, borrowing the Hawaiian word __wiki__ ([etymology](http://c2.com/doc/etymology.html)) which means "fast" or "quick" and doubled for emphasis __wiki-wiki__, "very quick." Part of his original description was "the simplest online database that could possibly work." ([here](http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki))

## The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) states that "A wiki enables communities to write documents collaboratively, using a simple markup language and a web browser… A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex and networked text, argument and interaction.”

## Wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.

## 

## I believe the Wiki philosophy offers unique expressive and collaborative power, and may provide “a system around which fellowship can form.”

## I love the phrase "an algebra for **ideas**".

## To me, that concept is reminiscent of the [[Glass Bead Game]] and efforts to create 'playable' forms of the Game.

## 

## [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) described at its website:
### … a unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.

### … a rich, interactive tool for manipulating data with structure that doesn't easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or word processors.

### … designed to fit around your brain, helping you deal with the things that won't fit.

### The fundamental idea is that information is more useful and reusable if we cut it up into the smallest semantically meaningful chunks — tiddlers — and give them titles so that they can be structured with links, tags, lists and macros.

### Tiddlers use a [WikiText](https://tiddlywiki.com/#WikiText) notation that concisely represents a wide range of text formatting and hypertext features. TiddlyWiki aims to provide a fluid interface for working with tiddlers, allowing them to be aggregated and composed into longer narratives.

## 

## According to its creator, TiddlyWiki provides "an algebra for tiddlers", a concise way of expressing and exploring the relationships between items of information…

## Other systems have analogous concepts with more prosaic names: like "items", "entries", "entities".  Even though "tiddler" is a vaguely preposterous name it at least has the virtue of being confusingly distinctive rather than confusingly generic.

## From my former wiki (2011-2016):
### **re:muse** has benefited from the work of other Wiki developers, including:

### ((7fe9c6da-2a9f-49a6-98b0-01ab7e41e418)), the creator of TiddlyWiki, and through his company Osmosoft (purchased by BT / British Telecom), he created [TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com/)

### ((4ffdb79e-74a0-4c6d-9d76-d62d7f4af4a1)), the creator of Tank and a principal architect of [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com/)

### [Tobias Beer](http://tobibeer.tiddlyspace.com/#Welcome) who created the visual theme which I use

### [Udo Borkowski](http://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de/) who created PartTiddlerPlugin

### Simon Baird of [Tiddlyspot](http://tiddlyspot.com/?page=about) (a hosting service)

### I am grateful to [Eric Shulman](http://tiddlytools.com/) of TiddlyTools for assistance he provided enhancing this wiki, including four wiki plugins I often use:
#### NestedSlidersPlugin, SearchOptionsPlugin,
StorySaverPlugin, and ImageSizePlugin
