## from [The Labyrinth of Solitude](https://myweb.rollins.edu/jsiry/Labyrinth1953Contents.html#LabyrinthOSoledad):
### "The writer's first obligation is fidelity to his language. The writer has no other instrument but words. Unlike the tools of the artisan or painter or musician, words are full of ambiguous and even contradictory meanings. Using them should mean clarifying them, purifying them, making them true instruments of our thinking rather than masks or approximations. Writing implies a profession of faith and an attitude that transcends rhetoric and grammar…

### Every literary style is something more than a way of speaking. It is a way of thinking, an implicit or explicit judgment of reality. Language is by nature social, while the writer must work in solitude, and therefore they establish a very strange relationship: thanks to language the modern writer participates in the life of the community, although the other means of communication with his people and his times __have broken down__…

### Due to the universal nature of the Catholic religion — which was a religion for everyone, especially orphans and the disinherited — (though often forgotten by its followers as well as its opponents) … No man was alone, however humble his situation, and neither was society: this world and the next, life and death, action and contemplation were experienced as totalities, not as isolated acts or ideas. Every fragment participated in the whole, which was alive in each one of its parts."

## From [The Monkey Grammarian](http://myweb.rollins.edu/jsiry/MonkeyGrammarian.html):
### "Wisdom lies neither in fixity, nor in change, but in the dialectic between the two."

### "What we call nature: that totality of objects and processes that surrounds us and alternately creates us and devours us — is neither our accomplice nor our confidant."

## **The beginning of the Beginning**
### from "A Tale of Two Gardens", page 295-299 of
__The Collected Poems of Octavio Paz, 1957-1987__

### 

### One day,
as if I had returned,
not to my house,
but to the beginning of the Beginning,
I reached a clarity.

### …

### I heard a dark green murmur
burst from the center of the night: the neem tree

### …

### The tree would not give way.
Huge as a monument to patience,
fair as the balance that weighs
a dewdrop,
a grain of light,
an instant.

### …

### Strength is fidelity,
power reverence:
no one ends at himself,
each one is an all
in another all,
in another one.
The other is contained in the one,
the one is another:
we are constellations.
The enormous neem
once knew how to be small.
At its feet
I knew I was alive,
I knew
that death is expansion,
self-negation is growth.
I learned,
in the brotherhood of the trees,
to reconcile myself,
not with myself:
with what lifts me, sustains me, lets me fall.
