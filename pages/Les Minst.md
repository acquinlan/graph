## Les ~ also evoking the common or [lay](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#%5B%5BJourney's%20Etymologies%2Flay%5D%5D) people: __laos esse__ (intermingling Greek and Latin roots)

## Minst also evokes a __minstrel__ and the original sense of __minister__ (servant) … contrasted with __magister__ (as in [Magister Ludi](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#%5B%5BGlass%20Bead%20Game%5D%5D).)

## 

## Another facet of Les Minst is revealed by the motto **Miserando atque Eligendo**, which has often been translated as "lowly but chosen." I differ with that English construction, and catch a glimmer of Buddhist teachings in this Latin / Roman Catholic phrase.
### 1. We live in miserando [or dukkha]: we suffer, strive, and grasp intertwined with all of living.

### 2. Miserando rises from attachment: from blind human will to power and pleasure. Craving and suffering are two faces of an untamed will.

### 3. I embrace and transcend miserando. Every day offers a new start to tend the Seed of Perfection, if we nurture our bodies and relationships, honoring the sanctity of all life.

### 4. This is Ground-Divine; here we make peace and walk the noble path. Awarely choose love.

### 

## Those who cannot feel the littleness of great things in themselves are apt to overlook the greatness of little things in others.

## **Dasein** is a German word which means "being there" or "presence" (German: da “there"; sein “being") often translated in English with the word "existence". In my description of [Les Minst](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#%5B%5BLes%20Minst%5D%5D), I punctuate as da_Sein and translate as "__into__ Being" (a living being enters a time and place, in the stream of history.) The underline denotes the space "between" — das Zwischen.

### Rilke's __Überzähliges Dasein__ is read in English as **supernumerous existence** – welling up, like a song, in the heart.
#### See [The Duino Elegies](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#%5B%5BThe%20Duino%20Elegies%5D%5D).

### Dasein is a fundamental concept in the existential philosophy of Martin Heidegger, who [in his later writings?] focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behavior itself depends on a prior "openness to being." The essence of being human is maintaining this openness. Heidegger contrasts this openness with the "will to power" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this original openness.

### Two recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are [poetry](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#poetry) and [technology](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#%5B%5BEvocative%20Technology%5D%5D). Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of "revealing."

### Another German philosopher [Walter Benjamin](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#%5B%5BWalter%20Benjamin%5D%5D) wrote: "The most essential contents of existence [__wesentlichsten lnhalte des Daseins__] are imprinted [__auszuprägen__] **upon the world of things**, and without this imprint [__Ausprägung__] these contents could not be realized" … and that "We penetrate the mystery only to the degree that we recognize it in the everyday world."
