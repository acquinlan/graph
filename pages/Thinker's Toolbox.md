## In 2016, I suggested slight name changes
### __Quantitas__ to __Quanta__

### __Bushido__ to __Numina__

### and __Logos__ to **οφαλ**
#### Oikos Philos Anthropos Logos
##### **__oikos__** – house/home
###### __Ecumenical__: from Late Latin oecūmenicus, from Greek oikoumenikos, from (hē) oikoumenē (gē), __(the) inhabited (world)__, present passive participle of oikein, to inhabit, from oikos, __house__.

##### **__philos__** – friendship/love
###### the basic life urge in a "social animal": a desiring, suffering, death-conscious and time-conscious creature.

##### **__anthropos__** – humankind
###### __homo sapiens__ "the wise" a creature who "can carry the chemistry and the distance of a star inside his head." (((94430345-32b5-4e01-9ebc-b1c93952c89d)))

##### **__logos__** – word
###### language, signs and symbols

###### __Logos__ in a Greek (Deist? Aurelian?) understanding – all the inherited meanings and living meanings being-made by humankind.

##### 

##### **οφαλ**
###### omicron – corresponds with the Phoenician __ayin__ 'eye'
####### Greek __o mikron__ 'small o' contrasted with __ō mega__ 'great o', which is the final letter of the Greek alphabet

###### phi – this symbol is used to signify the golden ratio (1 + √5) ÷ 2

###### alpha – the first letter of the alphabet, corresponds to the Hebrew __aleph__

###### lambda – corresponds to the Hebrew __lamed__
####### also the symbol of lambda calculus

##### 

##### Living matter **forms** to a certain state — mostly certain, but according to a natural design.

##### Organic design (not by man) is in essence a 'life plan', {{{alias ((36e858fa-b3d3-48eb-911f-d0945b94596f))natusmorimundi}}}

##### 'The World' is the transformation of a rocky terrestrial (Earth-like) planet into a home.

##### 

##### Non-organic matter, on the other hand, fluxes from one form to the next, according to laws and conditions but with little or no certainty. Think of the weather.  It has patterns and is somewhat predictable, but can you think of any predictions that are less certain?  Humans use concepts like Chaos Theory to describe non-living complex systems such as weather.

##### 

##### Seeing the {{{alias ((d6151869-d7d8-4386-934c-6f83a21900d9))formoftheformless}}} in **__oikos__**:
###### Home, rather than human kind, dethrones man — as I feel we should — from the center of life.  Human consciousness is a great perfection of nature, indeed.  But our home in space and time, the ground upon which we stand and spring from, is a deeper and more enduring form than any human __I__ or a collection of __I's__ can ever be.  This is even despite our new-found capacities to rule the earth or even destroy the perfection dwelling on its outer crust.

## 

## These disciplines could be paired "transhemispherically", perhaps?
### Quanta–Lingua

### Numina–Ars

### Physik–Vivitas

### Psyche–Techne

### Opus–Ethik

### οφαλ–Moksha
