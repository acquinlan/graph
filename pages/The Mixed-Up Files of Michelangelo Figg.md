## __Not all are blessed with true vision. Some must spend a lifetime searching, building dream upon dream.__

## __The wild, free tree is only the key to the perfect dream.__

## __… There are many trees — each must find his own Capri.__

## a germinating hypertext universe which draws inspiration from two books I read in my childhood:
### __From the Mixed-Up Files of Basil E. Frankweiler__
#### by E.L. (Elaine Lobl) Konigsburg, published 1967

### __Figgs & Phantoms__
#### by ((d5b89bbb-4893-4693-a48c-cba659cbe57c)), published 1974

## The plot of Konigsburg's book involves Michelangelo's early __Angel__ statue (which he began sculpting when he was about 19 years old.)

### The story's protagonist is 12 year old Claudia Kincaid.

## 

## The protagonist of Raskin's book is a young girl Mona Lisa Figg, and another primary character was her uncle Florence Italy Figg.
### N.B. both  & ((fb52cfbf-4db2-4dd2-af7f-f8313d3d58e6)) lived in Florence, Italy.

## The book described Mona reading a passage from Joseph Conrad's __Heart of Darkness__:
### It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream — making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams. . . .
#### No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence — that which makes its truth, its meaning — its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dream — alone. . . .

#### __"a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that time"__
##### (subsequent passages not quoted in Raskin's book)
