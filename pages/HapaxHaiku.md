### YOU only occur
ONCE: anti-etymological,
           the wind WRIT.

### 

### __This word was my entry-point to the Hapax Hegemon, called to my attention by the lexicographer Erin McKean.__

### See further elaboration:
#### Written on the [gravestone](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=566&PIpi=8281991) of John Keats: __"Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water".__
##### An old friend of mine, adopted at birth and with no children of his own, took this as his inspiration when writing __"I am more than content to be a man whose name was written in the wind."__

##### The three forces here are **YOU** (human identity), **ONCE** (temporality), and **WRIT** (capitalized thusly, it reminds me of 'the great, megalithic death' that is history.)

#### A [hapax legomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon) is a word or word form that occurs only once within a context, either in the written record of an entire language, in the works of an author, or in a single text.

#### According to the OED, a **hegemon** is a leading or paramount power. Hegemons are [elsewhere described](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hegemon) as powerful entities with "a predominating influence over others… This word suggests dominance and often a little more power than others would prefer."

### Deft-quivering stitch
Loops in/out, then turns again;

#### In the first poem, I was likely led by the influence of Madeline [L'Engle](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#L'Engle) quoting from Psalm 121: "The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night."

## 

## **Background:**
### [Leonard Richardson](https://www.crummy.com/) created a Twitter bot called **Hapax Hegemon** which posts words that only occur once in the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) corpus.

### I discovered [HapaxHegemon](https://twitter.com/hapaxhegemon) on June 26, 2016. First I thought an actual person was posting the words, which looked to be coinages or novel compound words. I tweeted back my own words that seemed a fitting response, thinking that the author would understand my intent.

### All from 6/26/2016:
#### fast-silvering / deft-quivering

#### disapppointed / dysannointed

#### worth-and / claim-nor  [I thought of Paul Ricoeur's [[triple quest]] of having/power/worth.]

### When I saw that over 21,000 tweets had been posted, and they appeared every hour, I realized that a software "bot" was behind it.

### I then took to writing #haiku which drew from these __hapax hegemona__. Back in 2014, Leonard Richardson wrote that his bot "won't stop until we're all dead", and filed [his remarks](https://www.crummy.com/2014/01/07/0) under the category "art". Now I will follow the prompts of machine code to create my own art.
