## From __One Immigrant's Legacy: The Overmyer Family in America, 1751-2009__ by Laurence Overmire:
### Over the course of the millennia, all these multitudes of ancestors, generation upon generation, have come down to this moment in time — to give birth to you. There has never been, nor will ever be, another like you. You have been given a tremendous responsibility. You carry the hopes and dreams of all those who have gone before. Hopes and dreams for a better world. What will you do with your time on this Earth? How will you contribute to the ongoing story of humankind?

### … History remembers only the celebrated, genealogy remembers them all.

## From __The Family Tree Detective__ (1983) by Colin D. Rogers:
### Paternity can never be proved, even when no-one has expressed any doubt about it.
#### __[Fortunately, affordable DNA testing has improved our capability to "prove" direct male lineage, particularly those with an uncommon Y-chromosome signature, such as my own.]__

### Often a connection will have to be accepted because there is no apparent alternative; and sooner or later all genealogists must consciously accept what is only the most probably solution to a problem they are trying to solve.

### It has been said that the history of population is all about sex and death; genealogy is all about parents and how to find them. __[Genealogy, too, can be reduced to "sex and death."]__

### It is true, of course, that sooner or later anyone tracing a family tree will be interested in marriages, gravestones, tax returns and a host of documents which supply evidence about named individuals; but in the end, when human beings have learnt how to avoid death and have outgrown marriage as a social institution, the genealogist's basic task will remain the same — to discover parents. It is a genetic quest — few people would prefer to trace foster or adoptive parents rather than their real ones.

## From __Genealogy as Critique: Foucault and the Problems of Modernity__ (2013) by Colin Koopman:
### Genealogies articulate problems. But not just any problems. Genealogies do not take up those problems that come with supposed solutions readily apparent… Genealogies are concerned, rather, with **submerged problems that condition us** without our fully understanding why or how.

### They are depth problems in that they are lodged deep inside all of us… Yet despite their depth, these problems are also right at the surface insofar as they condition us in our every action, our every quality, our thought, our every sadness and smile…

### The point of a genealogy is not just to denaturalize but to show __how__ that which is so easily taken as natural was composed into the natural-seeming thing that it is.

## Michel Foucault:
### "The body: a surface on which events are inscribed (whereas language marks events and ideas dissolve them), place where the Me is dissociated (a Me to which it tries to lend the illusion of a substantial unity), it is a volume perpetually crumbling away. **Genealogy, as an analysis of where things come from is thus situated at the point of articulation of the body and history.** Its task is to show a body totally imprinted with history, and history destroying the body."

### The **Mixtec** __[Nahuatl word 'mixtecah' – 'cloud people', for the indigenous peoples of southern Mexico]__ genealogical histories conceived in [screenfold](http://www.mesolore.org/tutorials/learn/10/Mesoamerican-Screenfolds) format follow a ((73f47840-23a1-482f-9ecb-8613a4f82232)) pattern. The stories flow back and forth, the way an ox plow would work a field, across one or two pages… There is considerable variation in the actual reading order between manuscripts and even within the same manuscript. The [Codex Selden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Selden) [a pre-Columbian genealogy from the tenth to sixteenth century] reads bottom to top, whereas most of the others read horizontally…

### It is not always easy to understand the reading order when one opens a Mixtec screenfold in the middle. The usual rule is that the figures face in the direction the story moves, but manuscripts like the [Codex Zouche-Nuttall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Zouche-Nuttall) are flexible in this regard; and in other manuscripts, conferences and confrontations between people cause many individuals to face against the flow. Also, individuals in parentage statements always face the offspring…

### In codices like the [Colombino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Colombino) and [Bodley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Bodley) that read across two pages, the reader may have to interpret a section of the story before recognizing the reading order. Three of the Mixtec codices have dual registration: the main **story line** is paralleled by a concurrently running story that offers supporting or background material. These supplementary registers are almost like footnotes to the principal narrative.
