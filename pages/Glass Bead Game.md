title: Glass Bead Game
---

## From Hesse's book:
### These rules, the sign language and grammar of the Game, constitute a kind of highly developed ~~secret~~ language drawing upon several sciences and arts, but especially mathematics and music. [This language is] capable of expressing and establishing interrelationships between the content and conclusions of nearly all ~~scholarly~~ disciplines.
#### [words struck out which I see as limiting or misguided for an actual GBG]

### 

### The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing with the **total contents and values of our culture**; it plays with them as…a painter might have played with the colours on his palette. All the insights, noble thoughts, and works of art that the human race has produced … all that subsequent periods of scholarly study have reduced to concepts and converted into intellectual property — on all this immense body of intellectual values the Glass Bead Game player works like the organist on an organ. And this organ has attained an almost unimaginable perfection; its stops are almost beyond number. Theoretically this instrument is capable of reproducing in the Game the entire intellectual content of the universe.

## 

## I envision a game, a song, a vast possibility space, roiling with "the total contents and values of our culture."

## 

## "The Memory of the City of Mind was incalculably vast. Endless knowledge was there, if one could get at it; for the goal of the Mind was to become **a total mental model or replica of the Universe**."
