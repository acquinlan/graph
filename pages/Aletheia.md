title: Aletheia
---

## __Aletheia__ is a Greek word variously translated as "unclosedness", "unconcealment", "disclosure" or "truth".

## Using the interpretation of Martin Heidegger, __aletheia__ is distinct from conceptions of truth:
### * understood as statements which accurately describe a state of affairs (**correspondence**) – as in veritas?

### * or statements which fit properly into a system taken as a whole (**coherence**).

## Instead, Heidegger focused on the elucidation of how an ontological "world" is disclosed, or opened up, in which things are made intelligible for human beings in the first place, as part of a holistically structured background of meaning.

## Martin Heidegger began his discourse on the reappropriation of __aletheia__ in his magnum opus, __Being and Time__ (1926), and expanded on the concept in his __Introduction to Metaphysics__. For more on his understanding of aletheia, see __Poetry, Language, and Thought__, in particular the essay entitled "The Origin of the Work of Art", which describes the value of the work of [art](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html#art) as a means to open a "clearing" for the appearance of things in the world, or to disclose their meaning for human beings.

## Heidegger revised his views on __aletheia__ as truth, after nearly forty years, in the essay "The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking," within the work __On Time and Being__ (1962).
