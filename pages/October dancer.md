## 

## From the sixteenth rhapsody of __The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel__

## written by the Cretan ((e00adfad-d522-4086-a69b-1607ac897722)) from 1924 to 1938

## 

## **High on the day-sentry's castle**
[[tower]], **October had come again**
### 

### __I am that bird who sings within a cage of flames!__

### 

### Newts, lizards, scorpions, **hedgehogs**, huddled on the ground…
#### lines 16, 18, 19

### __Only the herds of men were deaf, for the bird's song could not pierce through the thick-skinned shield of their soft brains…__
#### page 501 (167 x 3), the sixteenth page, line 608:

### One night an erring nightingale perched on his head,and as with that throat raised high it warbled its sweet song the **windswept man** could bear no more and softly wept,

### for, ah, a small bird's caroling unwound his heart; and as he listened to the bird sing to the wind his sentry mind forgot and left its gate wide open so that **Telemachus**, well nourished, sweet, appeared…"When, Father, will your heart grow sweet and satisfied?

### Man's feet were first created but to walk the earth, his hands to pull the oarblades or to grasp the hoe; but you strive to surpass man's holy measurement… At times like scorpions you spout flames in burning hearths, at times you freeze up like a winter snake, but never rejoice in the serene and sacred warmth of man."
#### page 516, advancing 16 pages more, line 1281 (3 x 7 x 61):

### His Soul hung over the cliff, all phallus and all womb, starved for a kiss and cried for males, craved for a kiss and moaned for female ghosts to come, then carved on air meaningless mystic signs filled full of light, and played but with no purpose, from sheer strength and without joy… His breast's cave groaned with echoing sounds:

#### "I rise high on the shores of time, **I shape, reshape** with water, blood, and sand the adventures of all man…I dance, and all the tight coils of my head **unwind**!"
##### page 517, line 1351, traveling up and down 16 lines

### When the great dancer had danced his fill, he shrank like fire…
#### "I'm all ships, all seas, all storms, all foreign strands, I'm both the brain-begotten god and the anti-god…

### For the lone man, freedom was a saddened power that crossed her hands and watched all things on earth with tears…
#### seventeenth rhapsody, lines 11, 26, 27:

### He changed to man, maid, god, together and apart,
and every moment in the darkness was heard falling, like honey from an unseen hive that swells in the **heart**.

## Above is my work of poetic collage (similar to the creative efforts I have called mitocos.)  The beginning of its title is taken from the first line of Kazantzakis' sixteenth rhapsody in __The Odyssey__.  The second phrase, "October had come again" opens Book Three, "Telemachus" in the novel __Of Time and the River__, published 1935 by ((72f42b42-56ad-4375-8442-d71fe47aee82))…
### of a stone, a leaf, a door. And of all the forgotten faces.

### Naked and alone we came into exile. In her dark womb we did not know our mother's face; from the prison of her flesh we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this earth.

### Which of us has known his brother? Which of us has looked into his father's heart? Which of us has not remained forever prison-pent? Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?

### O waste of loss, in the hot mazes, lost, among bright stars on this most weary unbright cinder, lost! Remembering speechlessly we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, **a stone, a leaf, an unfound door**. Where? When?

### O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.

### … Each of us is all the sums he has not counted: subtract us into nakedness and night again, and you shall see begin in **Crete** four thousand years ago the love that ended yesterday in Texas.

### The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock … Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years…and every moment is a window on all time.

### This is a moment:

## Telemachus (Greek: Τηλέμαχος, __Tēlemakhos__, literally "far-fighter") is the son of Odysseus and a central character in Homer's __Odyssey__ (a work composed approximately 8th century BCE.)

## 

## In the 1922 novel __Ulysses__ by James Joyce, Stephen Dedalus is generally regarded as corresponding to Telemachus.

## I correlate Telemachus — "well nourished, sweet" —with my son Aron. He questions me, "When, Father, will your heart grow sweet and satisfied?"

## 

## __The windswept man who softly wept, His Soul hung over the cliff, the great dancer, the lone man__ … all these are names for myself.

## 

## I drew a #correspondance in my title between the day-sentry's castle tower and the mythic Dark Tower.

## 

## The "bird who sings" is the first being introduced in this poem; taken directly from line 7 of Kazantzakis' sixteenth rhapsody. His following lines add __"Some call me God, some the great seed of crafty man…but I'm that still uncaught and burning bird, your heart."__

## This first introductory statement stands apart from the following 34 lines, which were culled from the sixteenth and beginning part of the seventeenth rhapsodies. The seventeenth line ends my son's questioning: __"you never rejoice in the serene and sacred warmth of man."__

## 

## The second half unlocks __this__ man's destiny (Odysseu s— and the poet's? — and my own?)
### __"rise high on the shores of time…shape, reshape…dance…change to man, maid, god, together and apart"__ … and hear the fall of __"every moment in the darkness."__

## 

## Including its title, Kazantzakis' __Odyssey__ numbered 33,334 lines, and each verse contained 17 syllables in the original Greek. As I move toward the "traditional eighth month" of 2016, the calendar marks my 34th birthday, and I conclude a second "life haiku".

## 

## As I, in the poem, listened to the bird sing, I made a linkage to Wordsworth's Prelude: __"that single wren one day sang…"__

## __"When the great dancer had danced his fill…"__ was quoted in this August 2009 [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908163519/http://mickeyandava.blogspot.com/2009/08/who-now-follows-call-of-sirens.html) posting.
