### __"What lifelines innumerable! How full the universe is!"__ (Henry Ward Beecher)
#### He went on to say: "No man can do his best work except **along the line** of his strongest faculties… How often most admirable men of ideas are mere copyists! They generate thought, **they have latent poetry in them**, they have latent inspirations; if they had been put in the right avenues, these men would have been thinkers, and **their life like the outpouring of music**… One half of the energy of life is badly applied."

#### 

### "We discern a **crimson line on this earth**" (((e00adfad-d522-4086-a69b-1607ac897722)))

### 

### __Water Lines__ by Luci Shaw
#### "Between the lines" poem

### Gary Snyder:
#### Even a 'place' has a kind of fluidity: it passes through space and time. . . . A place will have been grassland, then conifers, then beech and elm. It will have been half riverbed, it will have been scratched and plowed by ice. And then it will be cultivated, paved, sprayed, dammed, graded, built up. But each is only for a while, and that will be just another set of **lines** on the palimpsest. The whole earth is a great tablet holding the multiple overlaid new and ancient traces of the swirl of forces.

### Terry Osborne:
#### (who quoted Gary Snyder above)

#### "[A man] … chased by **the enemy voice inside him**, suddenly felt like an insecure boy in that valley. Perhaps he could discover home there and grow securely into it. Perhaps he could learn from its contours the complex ways of the land, and then those ways could teach him how to soften and bend the **lines** of his own divided nature — lines that made him feel split in two sometimes, bouncing back and forth between boy and man …"

### William Stafford:
#### For it is important that awake people be awake,
or **a breaking line** may discourage them back to sleep;
the signals we give—yes or no, or maybe—
should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.

### 

### "There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a **crooked line**"
#### Indigo Girls

### 

### ((7401ae37-ec63-42af-b190-807c7fe1a237)):
#### and they will recognize all **the lines of your face**
__in the face of the daughter of the daughter of my little daughter__

#### 

#### I saw a life, and I called it mine.
I saw it, drawn so sweet and fine,
and I had begun to **fill in all the lines**,
right down to what we'd name her.

### 

### Martin Buber:
#### "We do not know whether there is a recurrence [reincarnation?]; the lines of this dimension of time in which we live we do not extend beyond this life …"

### 

### Julio Cortázar:
#### "To provoke, assume **a text that is out of line**, untied, incongruous… to take from literature that part which is a living bridge from man to man… a narrative that will not be a pretext for the transmission of a 'message' __(there is no message, only messengers, and that is the message, just as love is the one who loves)__; a narrative that will act as a coagulant of experiences, as a catalyst of confused and badly understood notions, which first off will cut into the one who is writing it …"

### 

### lines of flight (Deleuze and Guattari)
#### This heredity of instincts transmits something well-determined. It "reproduces" whatever it transmits; it is a heredity of the Same.
But this is not at all the case with the heredity of the crack — for, as we have seen, the crack transmits nothing other than itself. It is not tied to a certain instinct, to an internal, organic determination, or to an external event… It transcends life-styles; it therefore runs its course in a continuous, __imperceptible, and silent way__… It reproduces nothing __[specific in behaviors and persona]__, being content to advance in silence and to follow the lines of least resistance. __[Or perhaps to the ripest ground?]__
As the perpetual heredity of the Other, it always takes **an oblique line**, being ready to change directions and to alter its canvas…

#### 

#### A rhizome oscillates between **genealogical lines** that segment and stratify and '**lines of flight**' and the dissemination that rupture the tree lines…

#### 

#### "Unlike the graphic arts, drawing or photography, unlike tracings, the rhizome pertains to a map that must be produced, constructed, a map that is always detachable, connectable, reversible, modifiable and has multiple entranceways and exits and its own **lines of flight**."

#### 

#### __"sustaining the lines, the slippages, and the rotations"__ (Giles Deleuze)
##### see [[Rotations]] — text extracted from "[Difference and Repetition](https://books.google.com/books?id=fqucRS3ta-kC&pg=PA8&q=rotations)"

### 

### Hermann Hesse:
#### "Since the end of the Middle Ages, intellectual life in Europe seems to have evolved along **two major lines**. The first of these was the **liberation** of thought and belief from the sway of all authority. In practice this meant the struggle of Reason … The second trend, on the other hand, was the covert but passionate search for a means to confer **legitimacy** on this freedom, for a new and sufficient authority arising out of Reason itself."

### 

### Arlette Farge:
#### In the murmurs of thousands of words and expressions, you might be tempted to look only for the extraordinary or the clearly revealing. This is a mistake. Seemingly insignificant and unimportant details can reveal what was unspoken… trace **intimate outlines** and capture the thousands of ways each person has of communicating with the world.

#### The archive lays things bare, and in **a few crowded lines** you can find not only the inaccessible but also the living. Scraps of lives dredged up from the depths wash up on shore before your eyes. Their clarity and credibility are blinding. Archival discoveries are a manna that fully justify their name: __sources__ as refreshing as wellsprings.

### "Three of the Mixtec codices have dual registration: the main **story line** is paralleled by a concurrently running story that offers supporting or background material. These supplementary registers are almost like footnotes to the principal narrative."  — {{{alias ((cf53e3ba-174e-4ae7-9e76-8d34eda11240))ElizabethHillBoone}}}
