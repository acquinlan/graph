title: axis mundi

## The __axis mundi__ (also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, columna cerului, center of the world, world tree), in religion or mythology, is the world center or the connection between Heaven and Earth.

## 

## The image of the __Cosmic Tree__ provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).
### In some Pacific island cultures the banyan tree, of which the Bodhi tree is of the Sacred [[Fig]] variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called "Ashwath Vriksha" ("I am Banyan tree among trees" – Bhagavad Gita).

### The Bodhi Tree is also the name given to the tree under which Gautama Siddhartha, the historical Buddha, sat on the night he attained enlightenment.

### The Yggdrasil, or World Ash, functions in much the same way in Norse mythology; it is the site where Odin found enlightenment.
