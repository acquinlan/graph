[#haiku](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23haiku%20%40museical&src=typed_query&f=live) for Solar Cycle 25

### 

### __On a human and social level, year 1 of solar cycle 25 has been a rough start.__

#### From the Wikipedia article linked above:
##### Since June 1, there have been 77 spotless days, compared to 119 in the corresponding period of cycle 24.  ([source citation](http://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles))

## How did __this__ #synchronicity work?
### I woke at 3:30 AM today, browsed Twitter for a while and found the word "helioscopic" via [@HapaxHegemon](https://twitter.com/hapaxhegemon/status/1326044477501313024),

### looked up the definition of a helioscope and learned more about sunspots than I ever knew,

### searched Project Gutenberg for "helioscope" and found the 1918 work __Tropic Days__ by ((2c47bf1f-5bba-4097-b000-879c1e01a4d7))

### then wrote a haiku "for Solar Cycle 25"

### — just 45 minutes after __this__ tweet, which I had no knowledge of:

### Apparently the first announcement of Solar Cycle 25 by NASA hit Twitter around September 15th.

### The last cycle began in December 2008, when my oldest child was about halfway through gestation. I don't remember hearing anything about it.
#### [NASA posting](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/07nov_signsoflife) from November 2008

#### "Sunspot 1009 produced the first solar flare above the C-class, a C1.4, on December 11, 2008 …
An international panel of scientists declared that month as the beginning of Solar Cycle 24."  ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_24#Events))
