## ((0983be4b-051d-4013-9e7a-c9be271d8731)), “How to Be Madder Than Captain Ahab”:
### If you want to write, if you want to create… You must write every single day of your life. You must read dreadful dumb books and glorious books, and let them wrestle in beautiful fights inside your head, vulgar one moment, brilliant the next.

### You must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads. I wish you a wrestling match with your Creative Muse that will last a lifetime. I wish craziness and foolishness and madness upon you.

### May you live with hysteria, and out of it make fine stories… may you be in love every day for the next 20,000 days.
#### [August 14, 2075 — I'll be nearly 93 years old.]

### ^^And out of that love, remake a world.^^

### … Each of us is all the sums he has not counted: subtract us into nakedness and night again, and you shall see begin in Crete four thousand years ago the love that ended yesterday in Texas.

### The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock… Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years… and every moment is a window on all time.

### ^^This is a moment.^^

## My former wiki (2011-2016) was titled [Remuse](https://sensemaking.neocities.org/remuse.html):
### Remused is an adjective, like amused or bemused — but more intensely under the Muse's spell. Every artist has their muses.

## Bradbury's words seem most fitting:
### **__a wrestling match with your Creative Muse that will last a lifetime!__**

#### Today is nonidi 19 Brumaire in the year of the Republic CCXXIX, celebrating the pomegranate.

##### See more about the [French Revolutionary calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar):
###### Created during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805.  The revolutionary system was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar, and was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in France.

###### There were twelve months, each divided into three [ten-day weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar#Ten_days_of_the_week) called __décades__.  The tenth day, __décadi__, replaced Sunday as the day of rest and festivity.  [__Nonidi__ was the ninth day.]

###### The five or six extra days needed to approximate the solar or tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year and called [complementary days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansculottides).

### You see. The Universe is blind.
You touch. The Abyss does not feel.
You hear. The Void is dear.
**Your wife is pomegranate**. The stars are lifeless and bereft.
You smell the Wind of Being.

#### [#synchronicity — I saved this poem to my Roam graph on November 10th, __before__ learning that day was "19 Brumaire" in the French calendar, depending on the year.]

### It was the thirst of many years restrained in our body. Chained words which we could not say except on the lips of dreams. Everything was surrounded by the green miracle of the landscape of your body. Upon your form, the lashes of the flowers responded to my touch, the murmur of streams. There was all manner of fruits in the juice of your lips, the **blood of the pomegranate**, the horizon of the [mammee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammea_americana) and the purified pineapple…
