## A not admitting 
of the Wound  
Until it grew it so 
wide 
That all my 
Life had Entered it
And there
was space
beside

––Emily Dickinson (envelope poems)

## 

## And if the world is far too interwoven
For us to justly **act** in it at all,
Yet action is the feedback of the given
From which the patterned world emerges in its fall.
### —Frederick Turner, from the poem "Death Mass" in Hadean Eclogues
