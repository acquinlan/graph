## "For there is no place she does not see you.
You must change your life."
### (She: Diosa)

## 

## From __The Fifth Sacred Thing__ (1994):
### I can't carry my own pain, let alone the weight of all of yours. __Diosa__, I have too many ancestors, one history of oppression would be enough to inherit. Leave me alone!

### "Then listen, listen to us, we are your ancestors too. I sold my daughter to the slavers, I loaded the cattle cars, I smashed the temples of the heathens, I applied the lash, I raped. We are your ancestors, we are the unquiet dead. Feed us, heal us, listen to our stories. Or we will feed on you."

### … hell worlds after hell worlds to be lost in, too many of them, the underside of the last five thousand years of history, and he could find no way out…

### "No, **we want you to sing for us, speak for us, redeem our lives**," the [[ghosts]] clamored, victims and victimizers, their voices intertwined.

## Aphrodite
### https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aphrodite#Etymology
#### Hesiod derives __Aphrodite__ from __aphrós__ (ἀφρός) "sea-foam"

#### Scholars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, accepting Hesiod's "foam" etymology, analyzed the second part of Aphrodite's name as *__-odítē__ "wanderer" or *__-dítē__ "bright"

#### Second part relatable to the Indo-European root __*dʰei-__ "to shine"

#### ((1907ca7d-1ba8-47ac-b2a4-d796d95ac8c2))

#### Daniel Kölligan has interpreted her name as "shining up from the mist/foam"

### We cannot know her eyes. And yet her trunk
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
like a lamp, in which her gaze now turned to low,
gleams in all its power. Otherwise
she could not dazzle you so, nor could
a smile run to that dark center where creation flared.
Otherwise this body would seem defaced,
a lump of rock with no vision, would not glisten:
and would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star:
For there is no place she does not see you.
__You must change your life.__
