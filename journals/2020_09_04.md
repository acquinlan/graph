## Shelly Jackson:
### I would like to introduce a different kind of novel, the [[patchwork girl]], a creature who's entirely content to be the turn of a kaleidoscope, an exquisite corpse, a field on which copulas copulate … the hypertext.

## 

## The writer sets her pleasure, her eros, against **__'the great, megalithic death'__** of HISTORY
