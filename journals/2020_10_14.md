## I have gathered a garland of other men's flowers, and nothing is mine but **the cord that binds them.**
### Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592)

## 

## Oh now we know
the rope is hidden in ourselves to climb.

## Frank Herbert — ((9933ebb6-1301-485d-9ffe-f85291f4ed95))

## 

## What is greater for us than all enigmatic webs at the margins of being is the central activity of an everyday hour on earth, with a streak of sunshine on a maple twig and an intimation of the eternal You.
