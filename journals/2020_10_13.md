#### The 4D equivalent of a cube, known as a [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract). The tesseract is rotating in four-dimensional space, and is displayed here projected into two dimensions.

#### Created by Jason Hise with Maya and Macromedia Fireworks. A 3D projection of an 8-cell performing a simple rotation about a plane which bisects the figure from front-left to back-right and top to bottom.

###### Jason: "I used Maya to model the room, split into separate parts for the ladders/framing and the wall panels so that I could switch the material used for each panel based on the room it was within. 4x4 matrices modeled connections between rooms, which I recursively 'unfolded' to render."

###### "It was built on top of my student code engine that we'd already been developing for about a year, and the project itself was probably a few weeks worth of work happening in parallel with other coursework."

## Charles Hinton coined the terms [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract), __ana__ and __kata__ in his book __A New Era of Thought__, and introduced a method for visualising the fourth dimension using cubes in the book __Fourth Dimension__.

### Influenced:
#### Claude Bragdon's A Primer of Higher Space (1913)
##### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Fayette_Bragdon
###### Bragdon enjoyed a national reputation as an architect working in the progressive tradition associated with Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Along with members of the [Prairie School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_School) and other regional movements, these architects developed new approaches to the planning, design, and ornamentation of buildings that embraced industrial techniques and building types while reaffirming democratic traditions threatened by the rise of urban mass society.

###### In his books on architectural theory, __The Beautiful Necessity__ (1910), __Architecture and Democracy__ (1918), and __The Frozen Fountain__ (1932), he advocated a theosophical approach to building design, urging an "organic" [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Architecture) style (which he thought of as reflective of the natural order) over the "arranged" Beaux-Arts architecture of the classical revival.

###### He had yet another overlapping career as an author of books on spiritual topics, including Eastern religions. These books include __Old Lamps for New__ (1925), __Delphic Woman__ (1925), __The Eternal Poles__ (1931), __Four Dimensional Vistas__ (1930), and __An Introduction to Yoga__ (1933). His autobiography __More Lives Than One__ (1938) alludes to both his belief in reincarnation and his varied career paths.

#### Algernon Blackwood's Victim of Higher Space (1914)

#### H. P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Out of Time (1935)

#### Robert Heinlein's "—And He Built a Crooked House—" (1941)
##### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"—And_He_Built_a_Crooked_House—"

#### Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time (1962)

#### Christopher Nolan's film Interstellar (2014)

#### P. D. Ouspensky — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._D._Ouspensky#Career

### Hinton was one of the many thinkers who circulated in Jorge Luis Borges's pantheon of writers. Hinton is mentioned in Borges' short stories "[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tl%C3%B6n,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius)", "There Are More Things" and "El milagro secreto" ("The Secret Miracle")

### Hinton's "scientific romance", the "Unlearner", is cited by John Dewey in __Art as Experience__, chapter 3. The story described by Dewey is actually titled "An Unfinished Communication" and is part of the second series of "Scientific Romances". The Unlearner is a character in this story, which might explain why Dewey confused the title of the story.
