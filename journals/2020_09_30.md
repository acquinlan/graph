### Fuller context from Barthes' essay:
#### It is by __tying__ fragments of events together that meaning is generated, it is by tirelessly transforming these events into functions [^^meaning what?^^] that the structure is erected: the writer (**poet, novelist, chronicler**) __sees__ the meaning of the inert units in front of him only by __relating__ them: thus the work has that simultaneously ludic and serious character which marks every great question: it is a masterly puzzle, the puzzle of the best possibility.

### 

### From the same essay by Barthes:
#### “To be a Book, to satisfy its essence as Book, the work must either flow (like a narrative) or gleam (like a flash of light).”

#### » Discussing __Mobile__: a 1962 book by [Michel Butor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Butor), which was dedicated to Jackson Pollock
##### __Mobile: étude pour une représentation des États-Unis__ — translated into English as __Mobile: Study for a Representation of the United States__

## The silkworm's motto: __Inclusum labor illustrat__ — precisely because I am enclosed, I work and glow with all my desire.
