## But the great task, the journey, called to me,
A journey I could only start from home,
And I was lost, could not find my way back,
And every effort only drew me deeper,
And how was I to know I’d not begun
The task already, but the drug of sleep
Had choked the memory of what it was?
### Frederick Turner

## 

## My food is the turbulence caused by the jut of consciousness
Into the flow of world-information, the swirl of spirit
Boiling about the point where nature, transfigured,
Breaks and shivers into the glow of the supernatural.
### Frederick Turner

## 

## Trapped as a man is trapped within the journey
Of his life, trapped by his strength as much
As by his imperceptible weakening,
And a soft drumbeat drives him on, his heart,
His destiny, even **the dark addiction
To reckless loss** that is the ache of being…
This thing I knew was dream kin to my soul.
__I need must follow if I would be whole.__

#### “I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me, what else should I have done?
Doesn’t everything die at last, and too soon?
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?”
