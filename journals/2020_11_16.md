## "The **adjacent possible** is all those things—ideas, words, songs, molecules, genomes, technologies and so on—that are one step away from what actually exists."
### In 2002, "Stuart Kauffman" introduced the idea of the “adjacent possible” as a way of thinking about biological evolution.… "It connects the actual realization of a particular phenomenon and the space of unexplored possibilities."

### A poem for today, "[Disposed](https://poets.org/poem/disposed)" by Khadijah Queen:
#### __Gear adrift I say—a phrasal anchor in me
& here at the summit no one I know
knows what it means…__
####
#### The drumbeat softens & I still decline to
admit how cowardly & **shipwrecked** I feel…
#### How fast can I choose differently
a presence I pretend
####
##### Her commentary:
“__Gear adrift __means something that is not stowed in its proper place, that could become a hazard under certain circumstances at sea. If I was trying for anything, I suppose it would be the comparison between that gear adrift and a person adrift, whether discarded or not belonging—but ^^not even sure they want to belong^^.  __Disposed__, then, has potential for a double meaning: either tossed away or inclined—as in an asserted feeling.”
